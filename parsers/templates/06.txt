The climate changed. We couldn't breathe. It grew terribly cold. Far too cold for us. Everything we touched was poisonous. Noxious gases and thin toxic airs flooded our oceanic zone. Some said we had brought it on ounelves, that all our activity had backfired, that we had destroyed our environment by an accident we had provoked. There were rumon of betrayal and sabotage, whisperings of alien invasion and mutant beings from another ship. Only a few of us survived the break. Conditions were so terrible that many of those who did pull through wished they had died. We mutated to such an extent that we were unrecognizable to ounelves, banding together in units of a kind which, like everything, had been unthinkable before. We found ourselves woz:king as slave components of systems whose scales and complexities we could not comprehend. Were we their parasites? Were they oun? Either way we became components of our own imprisonment. To all intents and purposes, we disappeared.
