Siam Mapped
A History of the
Ceo-Body of a Nation




IN THIS LAST DECADE of the twentieth century the world, pushed by the European Community, is moving toward a new kind of community. Multinational corporations, not a single government, increasingly predominate; markets and production are becoming global; the monetary system and the flow
of information and capital know no boundary. Asia, the Pacific world, and
America are trying to catch up with the European move. The world seems to
be preparing to go beyond the legacy of nineteenth-century Europe: nations
and nationalism will sooner or later be obsolete. At the same time, however,
the collapse of the socialist bloc has unleashed the power of nationalismindeed a rather old ethnic nationalism, which has proved more powerful than
Marx or Lenin would have thought. New "old" nations are emerging again.
Nationhood is strongly desired even as it becomes obsolete.
This book originated in such a context. A nation touches everyone's life. It
has a government, an economy, a social and cultural condition, all of which
affect individuals. Indeed, nationhood has a powerful grip that can hold
together a community whose members may never know each other. So powerful is it that lives can be sacrificed for it. It has inspired generations to strive
for innovative and constructive achievements. In fact, nationhood is desired
even among the radicals in many countries who may be no less loyal to their
country than their adversaries.
Yet the destructive effect of nationalism has been enormous. Indeed, its
destructiveness makes us more aware of the arbitrariness and artificiality of a
nation. At this conjuncture in which economic transnationalism and political
nationalism coexist, the study of nationalism and nationhood can take a new
direction. We are no longer overwhelmed by its pervasiveness and its pretentious. Such a consciousness has created a distance in the relationship between
individuals and their nation, for we can now examine nationhood from a van-

tage point which is supposedly beyond the world of nationhood. A nation
can be viewed from afar as a cultural construct of a particular historical context, a construct which embodies both virtue and evil. Such a position is not
real, yet it is not unreal; it is a discourse, a possibility of enunciating in a new
way, a possibility created as we are approaching the end of the twentieth century.
Taking Siam, the former name of Thailand, as its case, this book examines
how nationhood has been arbitrarily and artificially created by a very well
known science-namely, geography and its prime technology of knowing,
mapping-through various moments of confrontation and displacement of
discourses. Even the most concrete identification of a nation, such as its territory, and its related values and practices, all of which I term the "geo-body,"
was discursively created. The introduction addresses the issue of the significance of nationhood in an unusual way: by questioning the identity of the
Thai nation through the eyes of one of its own nationals, a supposedly
"inside" view instead of an Orientalist one, as Edward Said might call it. It
sets up the main questions and aims of the study with its basic concept and
methods.
Chapter 1 then explores several indigenous conceptions of space, both the
cosmographic or religious notions and the profane or worldly ones. It establishes that premodern societies never lacked the knowledge and technology to
conceive space. Chapter 2 lays out the modality in which the transition of
geographical knowledge could take place. By studying the early Siamese textbooks on geography, this chapter looks at the displacement of knowledge
through a semiological operation. Then a great moment of transition is
explained in similar terms.
Chapters 3, 4, and 5 study the displacement of the geographical knowledge
in three major conceptual and practical arenas: boundary, territorial sovereignty, and margin. In these arenas, modern geography pushed out the indigenous conceptions and asserted itself as a new legitimate "true" knowledge
in different ways involving diverse issues on every frontier of Siam. In all
cases, the semio-political operations were never simply intellectual or academic. The displacements always took place in diplomatic and political practices, in wars and interstate relations, even in papers of correspondence as
well as on the earth's surface. Chapter 6 describes how mapping has played a
decisive role in the creation of a new kind of Siam. Operating in tandem with
military force, mapping both anticipated and executed what Siam should be.
The geo-body of a nation emerged.
Chapters 7 and 8 discuss how the discourse of the geo-body has shaped
knowledge of Siam in a particular way that serves its own existence. Focus-

Thai Language Conventions

Tms BOOK adheres to the phonetic transcription for most Thai words, but
without tonal marks. This practice follows the "General System of Phonetic
Transcription of Thai Characters into Roman" devised by the Royal Institute, Bangkok, in 1954. Moreover, because of the constraints of typesetting,
the superscript and subscript marks of certain vowels and consonants are not
shown.
Exceptions are those names which have been transcribed by various other
systems or perhaps no system at all. In the case of a name which is widely
known or which can be checked, the owner's transcription has been adhered
to. Otherwise, the spelling follows the system of romanization mentioned
above. The English names of certain Thai kings, princes, and nobles, as they
are known among historians (Mongkut, Chulalongkorn, Vajiravudh) have
been adopted rather than the official lengthy titles. Likewise I refer to
Damrong, Phichit, Prachak, Wachirayan, Thiphakorawong, and so on
rather than their full titles and names. In most cases, however, their ranks
such as Prince, Phraya, Chao Phraya, and their longer titles are given in the
first reference to each.
Finally, as in conventional usage, Thai people are referred to by their first
names while Westerners are referred to by their surnames. In the bibliography, Thai names are entered according to first names.

THE EFFORT undertaken here is inspired by, and dedicated to, the friends who
lost their lives, who were physically and mentally injured, and the thousands
whose lives have been affected by the massacre on Wednesday morning of 6
October 1976 at Thammasat University in Bangkok. This effort is of little
value compared to their sacrifice.
Throughout the years in Sydney, my learning process, from improving my
poor English to the study of new ideas and the adventure into this research,
was under the guidance and care of my great teacher, Craig J. Reynolds.
Undoubtedly, he is one of the best: a teacher who not only masters the field
and embraces new theoretical concepts in humanities and social science, but
also dedicates himself to developing every one of his students. Without him,
this book would never have been written.
Special gratitude goes to Charnvit Kasetsiri, Kanchanee La-ongsri, Supaporn Jaranpat-Shigetomi, and Chaiwat Satha-anan, my teachers and colleagues at Thammasat University who, in different ways, helped me through
the turbulent college years and into the academic world. The comments and
encouragement of Ben Anderson of Cornell University have been especially
significant: though we have met only a few times, his inspiration, directly
and otherwise, has been vital for me in recent years. The comments of David
Chandler of Monash University and Anthony Day of Sydney University have
been valuable as well.
I would like to thank Sujit Wongdes and Singkom Borisutdhi for their

AFTER DENMARK DEFEATED Scotland in the first round of the World Cup soccer tournament in 1986, it was reported that 97 percent of Denmark's population of five million had tuned in to the telecast of the match. A TV
announcer commented on the remaining 3 percent: "Only the Swedes and
the traitors must not have been watching." 1 The humor of this comment is
revealing. It is a comic reference to the significance of nationhood in modern
times. Yet its tragic aspects are countless. As the world approaches the
twenty-first century, we witness the breakup of socialist Eastern Europe into
serious ethnic and nationalist conflicts among the would-be states. Indeed, all
over the planet there is conflict among people who identify themselves as part
of a particular nation against another. The comment about the audience of
the soccer match makes sense because the international competition evident in
the statement implies the wider context of hostilities, rivalries, and antagonism among nations in other spheres. The comment was intelligible because
it played with the normative perception of the nature of a nation and its relations to modern individuals.

The Two- Way Identification of Nationhood
On the one hand, it is generally supposed that a nation is a collective body to
which individuals must belong. It is further presumed that a nation is an
entity whose atoms or parts-its nationals-possess a similar nature. A
nation has essential traits commonly imbued in its members, who, moreover,
have the same national interest. Patriotism, loyalty, and other affiliations in
terms of ideas, sentiments, and practices appear to be natural relationships.
On the other hand, it is always supposed that a nation exists in the global
community of nations. That is to say, there are other nations who have other

1

essences and interests dissimilar to ours, competing with us, or even antagonistic to us. The discourse of a modern nation usually presupposes this twoway identification: positively by some common nature, identity, or interests;
negatively by the differences with other nations. Our modern civilization is
to a great extent based on these identities and differences.
How does the identity of a nation and its opposition to others-that is, the
two-way identification of a nation-come about? Or how is it made? How
can modern human beings talk, know, or act in relation to the nation?
Indeed, how has the knowledge of a nation been constructed in our civilization? The answer to these questions should not be framed as just another
study about the rise of a nation-state or nation building. Rather, this will be a
study of the discourse of nationhood. This study concerns the case of what
has been known as Siam or Thailand. But its significance goes far beyond the
case study. It applies to many other modern nations which have appeared on
the globe during the last two centuries.


Mainland Southeast Asia before Modern Boundaries

In Thailand today there is a widespread assumption that there is such a thing
as a common Thai nature or identity: khwampenthai (Thainess). It is believed
to have existed for a long time, and all Thai are supposed to be well aware of
its virtue. The essence of Thainess has been well preserved up to the present
time despite the fact that Siam has been transformed greatly toward modernization in the past hundred years. Like other nationalist discourse, it presumes
that the great leaders (in this case monarchs) selectively adopted only good
things from the West for the country while preserving the traditional values
at their best. Although a skeptic might doubt the validity of such a view, the
notion prevails even among scholars.
One of the most quoted illustrations of this selective modernization based
on Thainess was the reaffirmation of Buddhism as the state religion vis-a-vis
the adoption of Western science and technology throughout the period of
modernization. Another famous proof was the instruction by certain prominent Siamese kings regarding the extent to which Western knowledge should
be adopted: it must be based on its suitability to Siam, they argued, not on
the models or standards of its origins. But it is hard to determine exactly
what constituted the needs, appropriateness, goodness, usefulness, or right
things. The "right" things have never been clearly defined; indeed, it would
be impossible to do so. Thus various interpretations of Thainess are advanced
from time to time. This has been happening since the last century.
What was not "good"? King Chulalongkorn (r. 1868-1910) declared in

4

Introduction

1885 that the concepts of political party and parliamentary system were not
appropr~ate to the Siamese political tradition. 2 On another occasion he even
suggested that the Chinese attempt to form a political party in Siam was con3
trary to the interest of Siam and must be opposed whenever possible. King
Vajiravudh (r. 1910-1925) banned the first text on economics in Thai because
it was not suitable to Thai society. Apart from the monarch, he argued, Thai
people were all equal under him. Thus economics might cause disunity or disruption because it concerns social strata of rich and poor. Instead, he proposed his own economic philosophy based on a Buddhist precept that one
should be satisfied with what one has. Not only was economics forbidden to
be written about, but in 1927 legislation against the teaching of economics

was passed. 4
Exactly which things should be preserved is vague because the definition of
Thainess has been discursively defined and claimed by the authorities of
diverse ideological camps. It is well known among scholars of Thailand that
the monarchical institution and Buddhism are the most important elements
of the nation. King Vajiravudh proposed that the monarchy was most important to nationhood. Prince Damrong Rajanubhap (hereafter Damrong), a
great historian and administrator, once suggested that the three moral pillars
of Thai people were the love of national independence, tolerance, and compromise or assimilation. 5 The Phibun government during World War II
6
(1938-1945) initiated many ambitious attempts to civilize Thai culture.
Many commissions were established to stipulate what Thai culture should be
and to supervise its dissemination. A number of detailed practices-from private affairs to public ones, from domestic matters to social ones-were prescribed for people to follow. 7 Ironically, traditional clothing and the traditional practice of chewing the betel nut were prohibited, while trousers,
skirts, and kissing before going out to work in the morning were prescribed.
Some of these new elements of Thai culture did not survive beyond the life of
the government, but others have continued to the present day.
There are many other views about Thainess, and the definitions never end.
Thailand is a nation, though not the only one, which concerns itself with the
preservation and promotion of the national culture as if it might suddenly disappear. Therefore a government body has always existed for this purpose,
though its name and its tasks vary from time to time. One of the present
entities is the Commission for National Identity, which has had to define
Thainess in order to clarify its tasks for planning, coordination, and consultation on the security of the institutions of the nation, religion, and monarchy.
The commission has concluded that the nation is composed of eight elements:
territory, population, independence and sovereignty, government and admin-

istration, religion, monarchy, culture, and dignity. The commission, however, has expressed its concern that, "as we shall see, the meaning of the term
'national identity' is quite broad, covering all aspects of the nation to the
extent that it may cause some confusion and unclear understanding. Even the
eight elements as defined are not agreed upon by everyone" (in the commission). 8 In fact, in a small booklet of twenty-six pages, Ekkalak khong chat
(National Identity), three eminent persons have given various interpretations
of the elements of Thai identity. The elements are not in contradiction to
each other. Indeed, they all count, and readers are expected to accept all of
them. 9 The number of traits and institutions regarded as Thai seems unlimited. Redundancy is necessary and useful.
Although Thainess is never clearly defined, it is supposed that every Thai
knows it is there. One of the most prominent statesmen and scholars in modern Thailand, Kukrit Pramoj, confessed that he was not quite sure what identity means. Yet he was confident that it was imbued in him: "The identity
belonging to the people of a nation ... is ascribed to oneself at birth. Thainess for the most part arises together with Thai people. Being a Thai means
having such and such feelings, having a certain character. No one can change
these things." 10 If the domain of what is Thainess is hard to define clearly,
the domain of what is not Thai-that is, un-Thai-is identified from time to
time. Simultaneously, this identification helps us to define the domain of
Thainess from the outside. As Edmund Leach has pointed out in the case of
Upper Burma, ethnic peoples define themselves in terms of the differences
among ethnic groups, rather than in accordance with a set of shared characteristics of a tribe which is merely a sociological fiction. 11 This is what I call
"negative identification."
Quite often, reference to otherness is made by identifying it as belonging
to another nation. But the referent nation or ethnicity is usually ill defined.
In Thai, for example, fa rang is a well-known adjective and noun referring to
Western people without any specification of nationality, culture, ethnicity,
language, or whatever. Khaek is another term which covers the peoples and
countries of the Malay peninsula, the East Indies, South Asia, and the Middle
East without any distinction. Khaek also denotes Muslim, but by no means
exclusively so. That is to say, a reference is sometimes made regardless of
whether or not a certain characteristic really belongs to any particular nation
or ethnic group, because the aim of the discourse is to identify the un-Thainess rather than to define the characteristic of any particular people. Once the
un-Thainess can be identified, its opposite, Thainess, is apparent.
Examples of negative identification are not hard to find in everyday life. In
a conversai.ion between the Thai ambassador in Canberra and Thai students

Introduction

6

in mid-February 1987 about Asian people in Australia, the ambassador
instructed the students "not to behave like the Vietnamese." It is not clear
whether he meant the Vietnamese in Australia, the communist Vietnamese in
Vietnam, or both. Probably he did not care what his term specifically referred
to. In this case, the term "Vietnam" represented a sort of otherness or unThainess one should avoid, regardless of whether or not the Vietnamese actually behave in such a way.
Un-Thainess is sometimes not a matter of nation or ethnicity. A reporter
said that he once teased a Thai about being a communist, but the Thai did
not find the remark funny and quickly replied: "I am not a communist. I am
a Thai." 12 This is how the Thai state officially views communism as well. In
a nutshell, the rationality of the anticommunist act (1952), whose model was
the un-American activities legislation, was that communism is un-Thai in its
ideas and as a way of life. 13 Twenty or thirty years ago, during the Cold War,
a poster about the threat of communism was widely distributed to all primary schools. In the picture, a tiny map of Thailand stood under the threat of
a huge red demon originating from the mass of the Asian mainland to the
north. Here communism and other nations were combined as a demonic
otherness. (A similar but more recent poster will be discussed extensively
later in the book.)
The radical movement during 1973-1976 was from time to time accused of
collaborating with the enemy. The enemy in this case seemed to be communism plus other nations. Student leaders were alleged to be Vietnamese
descendants, since Vietnam after 1975 had become a symbol of the worst
otherness in the official Thai view. In the massacre of students on 6 October
1976, when thousands of demonstrators were attacked by police and rightwing paramilitary groups, some were lynched because the wild mob had been
indoctrinated to think that the victims were Vietnamese. Vietnam, communism, and radicals in this context function in a similar way to the Swedes and
traitors for the TV announcer. The existence of otherness, un-Thainess, is as
necessary as the positive definition of Thainess. Perhaps we can say that the
former is indispensable to the latter.

Thai Studies
Despite the unclear identification or constitution of Thainess, the notion is
obvious enough in the minds of Thai people. It is a "thing" on earth, and in
history, which possesses particular features, all of which are distinct from
others. For many Thai scholars, a study of the thing is what Thai people profoundly know better than anyone else.

The Presence of Nationhood

Thai people, scholars or not, have always been warned not to tamkon
farang ("tag along behind the Westerners"). For them, Thainess, Thailand,
Thai people, Thai studies, or whatever Thai, is something the Jarang can
ap~roach. but ~ever reach with the utmost intimacy that Thai people can.
!~Is Thamess IS what Thai people belong to and are part of. In another sense,
It IS what belongs to them and is a common part of their lives. The sense of
identity as a part of each other enables Thai scholars to presume a privileged
status in the field of Thai studies because "Thai" is not just an area of study
but an intrinsic part of them. By contrast, Jarang scholars have to overcome
an enormous distance between the writing self and the subject written about.
Sometimes the distance is explicitly and concretely measured, even along
:hailan_d's bor~ers. A leading political scientist on foreign policy once took
I~sue With foreign scholars on the Cambodian question, saying that those foreign scholars were remote from what was happening in Cambodia and along
the borders, unlike Thai (people? scholars? soldiers?) who directly experience
the effects. Therefore, he said, "I am sorry for the fact that some [Thai scholars] are convinced by the reasons given by those foreigners who look at the
problem more superficially than Thai."1 4
E~ward Said has a~gued that the discourses on the countries and peoples
outside Europe, particularly "the Oriental," have been a part of the European's power relations that constitute the presence of "the Other" in order
to confirm the identification and, more often than not, the superiority of the
European metropolis itself, rather than being the documentation of what
"the Oriental" actually is. 15 Nonetheless, the awareness of Eurocentrism and
its prejudice against others has been common among Western scholars for
quite some time. As a correction, apology, or cure for what the Orientalists
had done before, this guilty conscience has pushed Western scholars in the
opposite direction-that is, to recognize indigenous perspective. A recent
study on Southeast Asia declares that the work was done with "styles of
research which do less injustice to the peoples with whom ... we work."t6
But this opposite direction sometimes goes too far. Unlike the cases of other
colonial countries, the fact that there was no struggle between colonial and
anticolonial scholarship in Thai studies has sometimes led to uncritical intellectual cooperation by pro-indigenous Western scholars who have tended to
accept the established views of the Siamese elite as the legitimate discourse
about Thailand. 17 If the intellectual enterprise is constituted by power relations as Said suggests, in this context being indigenous becomes a privilege,
at least for many indigenous scholars.
While Orientalism has been inscribed basically as the Other of Western
civilization, the Thai of Thai people is the field of "We" or one's own self.

Introduction

The spoken, studied, or imagined reality is not a "counter-part" but a self, a
social and collective one. For this reason, a national community and its
numerous aspects-nationalism, patriotism, identity, culture, history, image,
worldview, and so on-are not merely the objects of scientific study. They
are aspects, physically and spiritually, of We-self for studies as well as for
empathy, loyalty, partiality, and obsession.
In the guise of scientific method and academic format (especially footnotes,
quotations, and bibliography), studies of Thai by Thai people have been
located deep within the paradigmatic discourse of We-self. This provides
them with certain viewpoints, sentiments, and values as well as constraints,
taboos, alibis, and plausibility. The field of We-self also has its own political
economy and its own questions dissimilar to the field of Thai study by foreigners. Thailand as seen and studied by Thai academics may not be the same
as that of non-Thai academics. 18 As part of the discourse of We-self, a study
seems to attain a natural authority and becomes the inside view on what is
good or bad for Thai, what is Thai or not. One famous subject which claims
this inside view as an incomparable advantage is the ethnographic study of
ideas or worldview. As one study claims:
[This book] would ... try to achieve some of the benefits of the new trend
derived from the ernie or "inside view" approach to ethnography by looking at
the Thai world view through the eyes of Thais. Though many writers in this
volume studied in the West, one expects that they are basically Thai in their
thinking and behavior. The writings in this volume then should reflect the
cognition and perception of Thai and not Western people. 19
The notion of "Thai" -worldview, people, eyes, thinking, behavior, cognition, and perception-in this statement seems to be homogeneous and
demands no further clarification because it is embodied in the writing subjects, or authors. This kind of research has become abundant recently, mostly
carried out by centers of ethnographic studies in each region and by historians. Consequently, we have worldviews of northern, northeastern, and
southern Thai and worldviews of Thai people in the Sukhothai, Ayudhya,
and the early Bangkok periods. 20 The methodology is virtually the samethat is, the cataloging of source materials according to the researchers' predetermined notion of what constitutes a Thai worldview. The writers then
paraphrase from their sources-folk tales, songs, proverbs, games-and offer
the results as an analysis of Thai worldviews. 21 None of them ever questions
whether the results are Thai worldviews or the outcome of the writers' taxonomies which are specified at the beginning of each research as a methodology. Probably it is assumed that both are the same thing. Again the source of

The Presence of Nationhood

9

the Thai worldview is a writing subject. The materials are merely the substantiation of the Thai-worldview subject.
This criticism is not a rejection of the particularity of a society. But the discourse of We-self is not only an exaggeration of such particularity-hence an
overemphasis of the significance of familiarity-but also a claim by certain
people and texts to have privilege, rights, or power over the field of Thai
studies or Thainess because of their ascriptive relationship, or having been
insiders. An indigenous view is a good antidote to the power relations of the
Orientalist discourse. But the discourse of Thainess has its own sphere of
power relations as well. In the context of global power relations, it may represent the periphery's resistance to the metropolis. But in the context of
power relations within Thai society, it is a claim to legitimacy of, more often
than not, the official or hegemonic discourse operating in its own particular
cosmos over the subordinated or marginal ones. As has been the case in the
postcolonial era, an anti-Western discourse may belong to an oppressor, not
the oppressed, to reaffirm its grip over its own sphere of power. Since the
definition of Thainess has never been (and never will be) clear, therefore, the
domain of what is Thainess and the power relations arising from it constitute
an arena over which different interpretations from various positions struggle
to gain hegemony.

Struggles for Interpretation
Since the late 1970s, the network of army-owned radio stations, which comprises two-thirds of the radio stations in Thailand, has broadcast two programs daily at 6:45A.M. and 6:00P.M. to call for order and unity and to stimulate nationalism and the awareness of national security amid the communist
threats from within and without. Its topics range from political commentary
on social issues, including attacks on the civilian and elected governments
from time to time, to letters and obituaries. But the themes are clear: what is
right and wrong for Thai people, how they should behave, and how to think
on every issue. It attempts to impose social and intellectual discipline, an
overt brainwashing program which penetrates into every house and every bus
two times a day. Quite often the legitimation given to such a standard view is
no more than "according to Thai ... [culture, values, tradition, history)." 22
Positively, the commentaries often quote history, the king's speeches, and the
words of the incumbent army commander as authority for particular aspects
of Thainess. Negatively, they usually refer to what is happening in other
countries, especially in Indochina, as examples of evil, degradation, and the
values Thai must avoid. To speak more precisely, the evil and degradation are

10

Introduction

often alleged to be whatever is happening in those countries: the Other.
Apart from mobilizing popular support behind the army, the broadcast is
23
clearly part of the official industry to produce a standard of Thainess.
While these attempts at standardization aim for inarguable interpretations
of Thainess, there are other contending interpretations. In all cases, however,
they challenge the official view only in order to propose yet another standard
of Thainess. To dissolve the notion of Thainess altogether is perhaps unthinkable. Even the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT), the most radical opposition to the Thai establishment in recent history, achieved its successful ideological propagation in the late 1970s partly because of its strong nationalist
sentiment, which was on the threshold of anti-Westernism. An obvious sign
of this tendency was the somewhat puritanical character of its cultural programs calling for traditional, populist culture while attacking the influx of
decadent Western culture and the hypocrisy of the state, which could not
prevent the deterioration of Thai culture. A student leader who joined the
party in the jungle and finally departed from it once remarked that, "considering traditional values, the Communist Party inherits the Thai legacy more
than observers recognize." 24 So far, Thai critics of the CPT have been silent
on this point. But is it because they have not recognized this conservative
characteristic of the CPT or is it an identical tendency commonly held by
those critics as well?
Another contending interpretation of Thainess which is more recent and
still influential is an intellectual tendency that attracts many people by its conservative radicalism. Basically it attacks the failure of modern Thai society in
the light of Buddhist Thai tradition, arguing that modernity, capitalism, and
consumerism have uprooted Thai people from the fundamentals of Thai civilization-hence the degradation of modern culture and the deterioration of
morality and Buddhism in Thai society as a whole. In turn, it calls for a
return to Thainess, the roots or fundamental values of Thai civilization, and
the reassertion of Thai intellect, all of which are based on Buddhism. 25 These
people also oppose militarism and the establishment, since militarism is
responsible for the degradation of Thai society and is in no way comparable
to the monarchical leadership of the past. 26
Some people of this current persuasion, moreover, propagate the idea that
Thainess is deeply rooted in the ways of life and the intellect of the people,
particularly the peasantry. Thainess and Thai intellect in this view are located
27
in the countryside and originate from the opposite end of the elitist pole.
Like the elitist Thainess, however, its opposition is Western culture. A book
of poetry by a prime propagator of this view claims:

The Presence of Nationhood

11

[These verses] go beyond the preponderance of the ways of thinking which follow Western philosophy.... [This] leads to the perception of rural villages
and development projects in a lively and realistic fashion .... [The verses are
written by] an artist and thinker who uses Thai intellect to challenge the Western one ... in an age when many artists are losing their Thai identity and are
moving toward new identities that are pouring in from other lands. 28

For the military, despite the constant threat from the left, Thainess is in
good health. For the Buddhist radicals, it is in crisis because of the preponderance of Western culture; therefore, it must be urgently restored as the only
alternative for the future. 29 As one Buddhist radical observed: "The present
generation of Thai people has departed from Thainess, feeling alienated and
losing pride in their own nation, because the elites of Thai society in the past
hundred years, preoccupied with tagging along behind the Jarang, did not use
their intellect in the quest for our identity." 30 Ironically, the concern about
the deterioration of morals is shared by another recently influential Buddhist
movement: the Thammakai (Dhammakaya), which is supported by some
members of the royal family and military leaders and which the Buddhist radicals detest. This movement expresses its distrust of Western knowledge and
culture and their effects on Buddhism. 31 This concern is not shared however
'
'
by a well-known anticommunist monk, Kittiwuttho. He agrees that commercial greed and higher education have caused the decline of morals and
spiritual faith in Western countries, but he is confident that in Thailand,
where Buddhism is the guiding light, technology and science will further the
Buddhist faith. 32
The point is not which interpretation should be regarded as the correct and
legitimate meaning of Thainess. Rather, while the alleged ascriptive and natural intimacy is believed to provide Thai people with familiarity or intuitive
knowledge about Thainess, it does not guarantee an unambiguous notion of
it. Nor are the struggles over this issue among Thai people less violent,
oppressive, and hegemonic than the Orientalists' desire to inscribe the Oriental. Charges of communism, subversion, rebellion, and lese-majeste are not
uncommon.
These examples also point to the fact that no matter which interpretation
becomes hegemonic, or what eclecticism is produced, the reign of Thainess
would be unchanged. Although the interpretations sharply disagree with
each other in many ways, they share a similar concern about Buddhism and
the threat of Western culture to Thainess. Despite their political diversity, all
struggling forces claim their legitimacy by adherence to Thainess. It is a paradigm of political ideas which no one dares to violate. If one is accused of

Introduction

violating this fundamental, one loses credibility and authority. This was a
strategy the right wing used to counter the rise of the leftist movement in
Thailand during 1973-1976, and it was partly the cause for the collapse of the
CPT. Having learned firsthand that the CPT had slavishly followed Chinese
models for the Thai revolution, and had even been under the direct influence
of the CCP, the young radicals who joined it after 1976 became disillusioned.33 To these young students, the authority of the CPT and the power
of its discourse on class struggles and Thai society had virtually disappeared
because of its foreign elements.
But Thainess, or Thai nationhood, which Thai people perceive as "Weself," the source, reference, and justification oflegitimacy, criteria, standards,
sentiments, inspiration, and antagonism, has never been seriously questioned.
Where and how did it come into existence? Is it really natural for Thai people to claim an ascriptive relationship with it? If not, how then is Thainess
made?

Siam as a Cultural Construct
Fundamentally, history is a prime database of what may be regarded as Thainess. Most interpretations of Thainess proudly claim to find support for their
views in history. In this sense, history also becomes an authority of what is,
and is not, Thainess. There is hardly any interpretation of Thainess which
does not use history to authorize its validity. It can be said that the oeuvre of
historical studies is the backbone of the scholastic and scientific discourse on
Thai nationhood. For this reason, if anything is to be done for Thai studies,
particularly by Thai people, it should not be another text to be incorporated
in the existing oeuvre. It should, on the contrary, be a challenge: a counterhistory.
A conventional historical study about Thailand always presupposes the definite presence of a political or socioeconomic "thing," a kingdom or a state
since time immemorial. Only by doing so can a historian talk about polity,
economy, culture, or the development and transformation of the thing. The
thing is given; the study only reaffirms it. This study, however, is a history
of how Thai nationhood was created. It will examine an episode which is
much celebrated by conventional historians as one which confirms the excellence of Thainess-namely, the making of the modern Siamese nation. But
instead of discussing the process of nation building, it will show that Siam
was a discursive construct. The Thai monarchs were merely the instrument
of the new discourse. And Thainess was nothing but a construct of humble
origin.

The Presence of Nationhood

13

As with other nations outside Europe, history regards Siam's struggles
against European imperialism in the nineteenth century as the advent of the
modern nation. Unlike others, however, Siam was never formally colonized
-a distinctive phenomenon Thai people are always proud of. Therefore,
Siam has been regarded as a traditional state which transformed itself into a
modern nation, thanks to the intelligence of the monarchs who responded
wisely and timely to the threats of the European powers by modernizing the
country in the right direction at the right time. Thus continuity, homogeneity, and the persistence of traditions, especially Thai Buddhism and Thai
monarchy, have been the distinct characteristics, or even the unique features,
of modern Siam. Despite some challenges, this established view of Thai history has occupied a firm place in Thai society, among scholars on Thailand, as
well as among the circles of young radicals today. 34 Of course, it lends
authority to militarism as well.
In Thailand, the established view was questioned by the Thai Marxist historiography of the 1950s and 1970s. 35 A number of alternative histories have
been proposed, particularly in terms of class struggle and socioeconomic
change. The advent of modern Siam in this view was the result of its entry
into the global market, symbolically marked by the formal treaty with Britain in 1855. The direct counterargument about the role of the monarchy in
building the nation-state emerged, as well, represented by the proposition
that the actual start of the nation-state was not before the end of the absolute
monarchy in 1932 and that Siam from the late nineteenth century to the first
three decades of the twentieth century was an absolutist state. 36
Alongside the domestic discourse on the Thai state, Western scholars
raised similar questions. Siam is regarded as an indirect colonial country, both
economically and politically, from the mid-nineteenth century through several dictatorial regimes after World War II. 37 The nation building and the
role of the monarchy in the late nineteenth century were also critically questioned as anything but the beginning of a nation-state. Central to this argument is the fact that the Thai state has been unable to achieve modern
national political integration of minorities of all sorts-ethnic, religious,
or ideological-with the majority of Buddhist Thai under monarchical rule. 38
In the discourse of Western scholars, the notion of the "thing" known
as the modern Thai nation has been recently defined in a heterogeneous way. 39
These challenges attempt to counter the exaggerated credit given to the
ability of the monarchs and the adaptability of traditional institutions.
Instead, they contemplate the impersonal forces in history and even attempt
to separate the seemingly nationalist monarchs from the birth of the present

14

Introduction

nation, emphasizing the inability of the Thai state, especially under the
monarchical regimes, to become a true nation-state. This socioeconomic
approach, however, must presuppose an archetype or a number of criteria
constituting the notion of a nation-state and then compare Siam, a given
socioeconomic entity, to that model. The task is to determine whether Siam
was or was not a nation-state or to discover the nature of the state by applying the qualifications stipulated by scholars.
An orthodox king-and-battle history assumes a static old-fashioned definition of the Thai nation-state and applies it to the past. An alternative history
proposes dynamism and process but only according to certain scholastic criteria found outside the history it describes. Indeed, scholars have tried throughout the history of the European nation-states to determine the true and natural constitution of a nation, that is, the truth or the identity of it. The entire
history of a nation presumes the existence of such an entity or presupposes a
definite qualification of it, as if its identity were already given.
This difficulty is not exclusive to the modern history of Southeast Asian
nations. One of the major questions yet haunting the historians of early
Southeast Asia concerns the formation of states. To be more specific, how
one can talk about a state's formation without taking for granted what a state
is-the criteria usually prescribed by social scientists, not by the early Southeast Asian peoples themselves. Thus historians sometimes doubt that the state
qualifies as a state at all. 40
Moving beyond the nation, Donald Emmerson has shown that even the
identity of the thing called Southeast Asia had not been known as such before
World War II. Colonial rulers identified the region in terms of dominions of
various imperial powers. It was warfare, not scholarship, particularly the Japanese occupation, that abolished the colonial distinctions. In addition, "making wars means making maps." The National Geographic Society produced a
map of Southeast Asia; the Allies established the Southeast Asia Command.
After the war, consequently, the term "Southeast Asia" became known even
though its definition has been a controversial issue. 41 Even as the former
Soviet Union and Yugoslavia become separate nations called Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, and so on, who can say for sure
whether Burma and Sri Lanka deserve to be unified nations or the separate
states of Myanmar, Mon, Karen, Shan, Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu, and others?
What has been believed to be a nation's essence, a justifiable identity, could
suddenly turn out to be fabrication.
Instead of searching for the true identity of a nation, Ben Anderson takes a
nation as an imagined community. 42 A nation is not a given reality. Rather,
it is the effect of imagining about it. Compared to the religious dominion and

The Presence of Nationhood

15

the dynastic realm, a nation is conceived as a new era, a new kind of community whose spatial parameters and temporal homogeneity have been formulated in various ways. This identification is possible only through mediation
by certain means such as language. As a prime technology of imagining
nationhood, a language works a nation out in different manners-for example, by a spoken vernacular, the written language, the printing press, a
court's language, a state mechanism like education, or the unified language of
a colonial rule. In short, a language enables a certain group of people to think
of their community in an unprecedented, spatiotemporal definition. Nationhood is an imagined sphere with no given identity or essence; it is a cultural
construct. We can know about it as long as we employ certain technologies
to inscribe the possible sphere. In turn, such technologies create the knowledge of it, create a fact of it, and the entity comes into existence.
Anderson's pioneering work does open up a wide range of possible studies
on nationhood. Yet it begs more critical questions as well. First of all, the
languages mediating the imagined communities in Anderson's study are at
the level known as parole to structural linguists-that is, the spoken, operational language of normal conversation. A language in a broader sense is any
kind of mediator between human individuals and the external world. What
are the other kinds of mediators-technologies, other kinds of languages,
apart from a vernacular-and how do they operate in mediating and creating
the imagined communities?
Second, Anderson seems too concerned with the imagination, the conceivability of a nation. It sounds as if a nation is produced out of one's head
and is sustained only as long as the reproduction remains in one's headhence an imagined community. One may still wonder how such a mediator
formulates the social institutions and practices which perpetuate the operation and reproduction of the imagined community in actual human relations.
The primacy given to consciousness over the operation in human practices is
always prone to idealism. Hence the new imagined community seems to be
created out of the frictionless propagation of new ideas-like inscribing a
new language on a blank sheet of paper. If a nation is not the first or the only
kind of imagined community, and if a new mediator does not operate in a
vacuum, then a meeting, contention, combination, or conjuncture between
the old and new mediators must have occurred.
Third, the identification of Anderson's imagined community is a positive
one. His linguistic mediation creates a sphere of identity, configuring and
defining the spatiotemporal axes of a field of commonness. Yet to figure out a
sphere of commonness is to identify the difference between that sphere and
the one beyond. An imagined identity always implies the absence of such an

Introduction

16

identity at the point beyond its boundary. In fact, ethnographers are familiar
with how problematic an ethnic identification is. Basically, an ethnic identification is a dynamic mechanism defining or demarcating the sphere of "us"
against "them." In many cases, the idea of who we are is possible only by
identifying those characteristics which do not belong to us, rather than by
considering positively any natural qualification of "us." Moreover, the differ43
entiation is cultural, not based on any natural quality, and can be changed.
This is a truth for the identification of nationhood as well.
This book is not another study of nation building, state formation, or the
origin of a natiop. It is not a political or economic history of the transition
from a premodern empire to a modern nation-state. It is a history of identification of nationhood: what constitutes the presence of Thai nationhood and
how has an identity of it been created?

Subject and Method
Nationhood comprises many elements. Anderson's work emphasizes that the
new temporal consciousness helps to formulate the sense of a new community in historical lineage (as distinct from previous imagined communities)
and the sense of homogeneous time of the new community. This study will
focus on another element of nationhood: the geo-body. It describes the operations of the technology of territoriality which created nationhood spatially. It
emphasizes the displacement of spatial knowledge which has in effect produced social institutions and practices that created nationhood.
The choice was not made for any theoretical or historical reason. Rather,
to challenge the metaphysical notion of Thainess or We-self, we should deal
with the most concrete, seemingly natural, and stable feature of a nation in
order to illustrate how even the most "natural" element constituting the
presence of a nation has been culturally constructed by a certain kind of
knowledge and technology. Yet this is done with full recognition that around
44
the same time, the "revolution in time" was under way and not unrelated.
A nation's territory is not simply a sizable piece of the earth's surface. It is
a territoriality. According to a geography theorist, "Territoriality [is] the
attempt by an individual or group to affect, influence or control people, phenomena, and relationships, by delimiting and asserting control over geographic area .... [It] is not an instinct or drive, but a rather complex strategy, ... [and] the device through which people construct and maintain
spatial organizations." 45 Territoriality involves three basic human behaviors:
a form of classification by area, a form of communication by boundary, and
an attempt at enforcing. Above all, as the basic geographic expression of

The Presence of Nationhood

17

influence and power, "territoriality is always socially or humanly constructed .... [B]ecause it is a product of social context, whatever is said
about it . . . can have normative implications affixed to it and can lead back
to a social context." 46 Likewise, the geo-body of a nation is a man-made territorial definition which creates effects-by classifying, communicating, and
enforcement-on people, things, and relationships.
Geographically speaking, the geo-body of a nation occupies a certain portion of the earth's surface which is objectively identifiable. It appears to be
concrete to the eyes as if its existence does not depend on any act of imagining. That, of course, is not the case. The geo-body of a nation is merely an
effect of modern geographical discourse whose prime technology is a map. To
a considerable extent, the knowledge about the Siamese nationhood has been
created by our conception of Siam-on-the-map, emerging from maps and
existing nowhere apart from the map.
The term "geo-body" is mine. But the definition of the term is neither
strict nor conclusive. Readers will find that it is flexible enough to convey
meanings concerning the territoriality of a nation. We all know how important the territoriality of a nation is. Unarguably it is the most concrete feature, the most solid foundation, literally and connotatively, of nationhood as
a whole. There are innumerable concepts, practices, and institutions related
to it or working within the provision and limitation of a nation's geo-body:
the concept of integrity and sovereignty; border control, armed conflict,
invasions, and wars; the territorial definition of national economy, products,
industries, trade, tax, custom duties, education, administration, culture, and
so on. But the term geo-body is used to signify that the object of this study is
not merely space or territory. It is a component of the life of a nation. It is a
source of pride, loyalty, love, passion, bias, hatred, reason, unreason. It also
generates many other conceptions and practices about nationhood as it combines with other elements of nationhood.
Despite its concreteness, or perhaps because of it, there have been few
studies on the history of a national territory. Most of them concern disputes
over territories and boundary demarcations. Such studies always presuppose
the existence of the territoriality of a nation in modern form. Accordingly,
they merely legitimate or refute a claim and therefore merely entail a political
history in a politico-technical sense. Only in the works by Edmund Leach on
Burma have the effects of the arbitrariness and recent origin of boundaries
been seriously consideredY Leach, however, merely exposes the limitations
or inapplicability of a modern boundary to ethnic entities. He does not consider its positive role as a creator of a nationhood.
The lack of interest in the history of a nation's geo-body has led to many

[

Introduction

misleading historical interpretations which assume a m~dern con~ept of s~ace
in explaining the incidents in which the premodern discourse stlll pre:ailed.
No study has been done on the relationships-either the transformation or
shift or confrontation-between the premodern geographical discourse and
the modern one. The absence of definite boundaries of the premodern realm
of Siam is not taken seriously, as if it were due to some practical or technical
reason.48 Many historians have demarcated the boundary of a premodern
nation retrospectively. Innumerable texts include anachronistic maps of historical space. In this respect, this study is not simply a record of how ma~­
ping has been implemented and boundaries settle~ by treaty ..Ra~her, It
emphasizes how the new geographical discourse displaced the mdigenous
one, generating conflict, confrontation, and misunderstanding. Central to
the whole study is the question of how a map created the geo-body of a
modern nation.
Geography is regarded here as a kind of mediator. It is not a given object
"out there." It is a kind of knowledge, a conceptual abstraction of a supposedly objective reality, a systematic set of signs, a discourse. The strategy of
this study is to analyze the premodern and modern discourses and then to
detect the moments when the new and the old discourses collided. Those
moments were in fact the politico-semiological operations in which the new
discourse threatened and displaced the existing one. They occurred whenever
the notions of geography, boundary, territorial sovereignty, and margin were
in conflict. Those moments could appear in every sort of social activity: diplomatic relations, scientific observations, correspondences, travels, textbooks,
warfare, and, of course, surveys and mapmaking. They could take place anywhere from the palace's study room to the jungle on a remote border. Those
moments of collision can be determined by locating the events in which
ambiguous meanings about space were signified, since the confro~ting discourses were playing upon the same field of terminology and practices. The
relations between mapping and military force are emphasized here as the
mutual operation of knowledge and power in executing the truth of geographical knowledge.
My use of the terms Siam, Siamese, Thailand, and Thai throughout the
book follows a simple criterion: Siam and Siamese are used for the country
and its people before the change of the country's name in 1941; Thailand and
Thai are used for the post-1941 context. This is done with full acknowledgment of the controversy surrounding the name: changing the name of the
country and its people was the political act of a chauvinist regime to promote
the domination of the ethnic Thai and their culture over others. But even
though the racial prejudice expressed in the name's etymology and in reality

The Presence of Nationhood

19

is far from dissolved, it is no longer the dominant signification of the term.
Application of the term Thai is now wider than its limited racial denotation.
For example, khwampenthai (Thainess) as discussed in this introductory chapter is not meant to denote characteristics of the ethnic Thai exclusively but of
the country's nationals as a whole. On the other hand, the usage of the term
Siam is more limited. Again, no one uses the term khwampensayam (Siamness)
to signify the supposed common characteristics of all citizens of the nation.
The new nomenclature has not been changed since its inception. But its
application and its reference, the country and people, have changed. So the
complications surrounding the issue will be left aside in this study.
Another term which is very misleading is "modern"-a vague and relative
term which hardly signifies any specific historical character. Indeed, except as
a proper noun, such as Modernism in the arts, it can mean too many things,
depending on the noun after it and on the context. The modern period of
Southeast Asia, for example, is not the same as that of Europe or that of the
arts. In the context of the history of Siam, this adjective generally means
westernized as opposed to traditional. But I wonder if the westernized Siam
of the late nineteenth century is still considered modern. Its vagueness renders other terms in relation to it-such as "traditional," "premodern," and
so on-ambiguous. In most situations, each of these terms is intelligible only
in reference to the others.
Moreover, the term "modern" usually implies a state of advancement, betterment, progress, even goodness or virtue. That is to say, it claims superiority over its counterpart, the premodern and traditional. This claim, of course,
is not necessarily true. Unfortunately, because of its relativity and vagueness,
the term is flexible and encompassing and therefore applicable to any occasion. As a result, it is very useful in this respect.

Indigenous Space and Ancient Maps

Chapter One

Indigenous Space and
Ancient Maps

MosT sTUDIES oN premodern Thai ideas of space tend to focus on the Buddhist cosmography known as the Traiphum cosmography. The Traiphum,
literally meaning three worlds, was an important doctrinal tradition within
Theravada Buddhism. In Thai the best-known text of this tradition is
Traiphurn Phra Ruang. 1 It is believed to be a major treatise of the Sukhothai
kingdom, a major Thai state in the upper Chao Phraya valley in the thir2
teenth century, though the actual date of the text is still in doubt. The significance of this cosmography is evident. Even in the late eighteenth century,
two prominent monarchs, King Taksin and Rama I of Bangkok, in order to
restore the kingdom after the old one was destroyed by Burma in 1767,
supervised the reconstruction of the Traiphum texts as one of their major
tasks. The outcome was not the recopying of Traiphurn Phra Ruang; rather,
the new texts were constructed within, and added to, the same tradition. It is
misleading, however, to assume that the Traiphum was the only indigenous
3
spatial conception before the advent of modern geography.

Sacred Topographies
In the Traiphum cosmography, beings are classified by their merit and designated to live in particular places according to their store of merit. The most
evil beings are in the lowest section of hell; the more merit one makes, the
higher the level where one resides. The store of merit can be accumulated or
diminished by one's deeds and account for one's next birth. By this logic,
one's present existence is the outcome of the previous one. Overall the thirtyone levels in the three worlds formed a qualitative classification of existence
in which the human level was simply one. Space in the Traiphum was the

20

21

qualitative manifestation of imagined existence. Yet all of the surviving
Traiphum texts give concrete descriptions of various worlds, particularly the
human one, as well as accounts of the movements of the sun and moon and
the seasonal changes.
While Traiphurn Phra Ruang and other texts of the same genre are primarily about beings at each level of the three worlds and the truth of nirvana,
with only a chapter or two about the cosmos, the planetary movements, and
the figuration of the world, certain important texts in this genre such as
Lokkabanyat and Chakkawanthipani are archetypes of cosmographic doctrines. 4 In Chakkawanthipani, regarded as the best of this cosmographical
description, for example, the content focuses directly on the configuration of
the earth and the cosmos: definitions of the earth and the cosmos; the size
and detail of each part (mountains, great seas, and the like); the four continents of the human world; stories of the thirty-six cities and twenty-one
country areas; descriptions of the world of deities and the underworld. s For
the human world, there are four great continents in the four cardinal directions of the earth's central mountain, Mount Meru, and seven rings of oceans
and mountains between the four continents and Mount Meru. Apart from
the southern continent, Chomphuthawip, the other three continents are little known, or known only symbolically. Chomphuthawip is the land where
the Buddha was born and all the known countries are located. Although the
description of this world is given in numerical details, which in most cases are
identical, varied depictions of the human world appear in different texts. The
world can be imagined in various forms.
The studies of this Theravada Buddhist cosmography and its shift to the
modern one in the late nineteenth century are well known to historians of
Thailand. 6 It is not clear, however, what the relationship was between this
cosmography and other geographical ideas. In fact, an interest in other ideas
of space is rare. Reducing the varieties of indigenous conceptions of space to
the Traiphum framework alone misleads us in two ways. On the one hand,
the human world of the Traiphum cosmography is treated as if it were the
native's view of the planet earth, a distorted or primitive one, contaminated
by false belief or lack of knowledge. 7 It is doubtful, however, whether the
symbolic representation-the maps of the Traiphum world-was in fact
designed to represent the planet earth. The fact that the depictions of the
earth are varied (for example, a square flat earth or a round one) does not
indicate the development of local knowledge of the earth or the lack of it.
More probably, it suggests that the materiality of the human world can be
imagined in more than one way, whereas the spiritual meaning of the three
worlds must be obeyed. The spiritual dimension is the "reality" of the

22

Chapter One

Traiphum space, and the most important knowledge needed to be transmitted correctly.
On the other hand, the indigenous conception of material space is ignored
as if it were virtually nonexistent. Under the domination of the Traiphum
cosmography, there were other indigenous conceptions of space, including
the concept of the profane, material earth. The classic study of Robert HeineGeldern on the relation of the microcosms to the macrocosms is the first to be
considered. Studying the architectural forms of Southeast Asian palaces and
religious buildings, he showed that the sovereign realm of a king, its center,
and his sacred residential space were believed to be the microcosms. Palaces
and religious buildings had to be designed according to the cosmographic
order. Within the Buddhist, Hindu, or Islamic traditions alike, the architectural space was a kind of spatial arrangement metaphorically related to the
cosmographies. 8 Yet the two kinds of space were not identical. The architectural space had its own set of rules, traditions, and patterns of change. In
fact, the sacred space of the center is a subject well known to historians and
9
anthropologists of Southeast Asian studies.
Frank E. Reynolds once toured four temples in contemporary Thailand
and discovered a journey into what he called a Buddhological space. He classified the Theravada Buddhist ideas into three strands: the Nipphanic philosophy, the Traiphum cosmology, and the Buddhological stories such as the life
of the Buddha, the Jataka, the stories of relics, prophecies, and so forth. The
three strands of ideas are interdependent, yet they are basically different
approaches of Buddhism. They even interweave with local beliefs or other
Indic ones. The mural paintings at the temples he visited tell the stories of the
10
Buddha's life in connection with the locales of such temples. The particular
locality of the temples and the universal land of the Buddha in these paintings
are tied together, apparently becoming a Buddhological geography which
does not necessarily correspond to the terrestrial earth we know. The painting is similar to an indigenous genre of legend, known as Tamnan in Thai or
Thamaing in Burmese, which connects the place and time of the Buddha to
each locality. Like the Traiphum worlds, the truth-value of this Buddhological geography does not lie in the accuracy of its description of the earth's surface, but in its representation of spiritual reality transmitted through the
story. Unlike the Traiphum depiction, however, the space it concerns is not
the three-world cosmography but the religious space of Buddhology. The
units of this space are conceivable in relation to local Buddhist stories, and the
paintings are another kind of spatial representation.
Another kind of religious space is the topography of pilgrimage and fate.
Charles Keyes has marked out the twelve shrines sacred to the people of

Indigenous Space and Ancient Maps

23

Lanna, now the northern provinces of Thailand. Each is believed to have
power over each year in the twelve-year cycle; hence one's fate is under the
power of the shrine of one's birth year, hence a duty to pay respect to one's
shrine. Keyes pointed out that the twelve-year cycle was an archaic, pre-Indic
cosmic order in the region which was later converted to a Buddhological one.
So the twelve Buddhist shrines took over the places of local deities. All of
them are believed to be related to the Buddha's life in one way or another,
although some are of rather recent age. The shrine locations may change but
the number must be twelve. 11 Moreover, the twelve sacred places together
f~rm a cosmic topography in which people make pilgrimages to worship,
etther to make merit or to secure a good fate. Remarkably, this topography
covers parts of today's Burma, Laos, and northern Thailand and connects
them to the origin in India. One of the shrines is in Dawadung (or
Tavatimsa), a level of heaven, and a proxy temple has to be assigned for people's worship. Not only does the shrine network extend across national
boundaries, but it also extends beyond the human world. It encompasses the
imaginative space of heaven and Chomphuthawip, as well as the actual terrestrial space of Lanna, Burma, Laos, and India where the pilgrims make their
visits. A map of pilgrimage, however, is nothing like a modern map of places
and distances on the earth's surface. It is more like a memoir of travels indiagram form, showing places with connections of some kind (see Figure l).12
The geography of pilgrimage was not the only pre-Indic cosmic order
which provided a framework for conceptualizing space. H. L. Shorto and
David Chandler have studied the spatial order of the realms of the Mon and
Cambodian kingdoms which were conceived and arranged by pre-Indic cosmographies. They were not imaginative space like the Traiphum order, however, but the spatial organization of the terrestrial earth, a "territoriality" in
Robert Sack's word. The Mon kingdom, an ancient realm along the southern coast of Burma today, was always divided into thirty-two myo (townships), not including the capital. No matter if the realm expanded or diminished, the number remained thirty-two. Stories of the origin of the
thirty-two myo are varied. One account held that they were pagoda sites
where the Buddha's tooth relics were enshrined. Hence the Mon realm was
the true Buddhist kingdom according to the Buddha's prophecy. Another
suggested that they were the seats of the prince-rulers who had white elephants, regarded as sacred objects of kingship. Shorto, however, found that
in any case the order was the same as the one for the worship of the thirtyseven nat, the indigenous pre-Buddhist spirits such as local guardians, mountain spirits, or ancestor spirits, many of which were later converted to Buddhism or became relics. 13 In short, taking all the origin stories into account,

Chapter One

24

the realm of the thirty-two townships was a holy space bound together by a
system of thirty-two sacred objects, whether they were white elephants, the
nat, the Buddha's relics, pagodas, or in most cases a combination of them,
with the most superior one residing at the capital. This was the cosmic rule
of the territorial organization of the Mon realm, as well as the Burmese realm
which adopted the Mon tradition.
A realm was arranged according to a cosmic order, be it an Indic or preludic scheme. A religious conceptual system rendered it sacred. The holy territoriality was marked by local shrines, many of which had celestial characteristics. Moreover, though the number here is not twelve as in the space of
14
pilgrimage above, the rationale behind the numbers was similar. The cosmographic ideas seem to be more closely related to the territorial arrangement of a kingdom, yet they were not the same kind of space.
Chandler studied toponyms in two old Khmer texts and found that the
Cambodian realm was a sacralized topography of places looked after by local
spirits (mesa, nakta) or places where sacred rituals were performed. Although
Chandler did not discuss the cosmic order behind such a spatial arrangement,
he emphasized another aspect of the list of toponyms: it was an indigenous
map of the whole realm before the map of modern geography was introduced.15
In the case of Siam, the notion that the realm was conceived as a sacred
topography is evident in the terms denoting a kingdom or a sovereign territory. Literally, the term anachak means the sphere over which the king's chak
-a sunlike disk representing sovereignty-could orbit. Another term,
khopkhanthasima, literally means the sphere bounded by sanctuary stones.
Sima or sema is the stone boundary marker of consecrated space, normally in a
temple, within which an ordination can be performed. It also refers to stones
of similar shape on the top of a city's wall. Thus a realm was said to be a
sacred domain under the power of the king's wheel or a consecrated territory
as within a sanctuary's sima. Apart from that, there is also a text in Thai from
the early Ayudhya period, at least the mid-fourteenth century, which is very
similar to Chandler's Cambodian texts. Although there has not yet been a
study of the sacred numbers or the federation of local spirits in the text, the
idea that a town has its own guardian spirits is well known. In Bangkok
today, the name of the guardian spirit, Phra Sayamthewathirat, is often cited
in a blessing of the whole country.

Imaginary Spatial Depiction: Ancient Maps
The Traiphum map is a pictorial representation of the existence of all beings.
The configuration of the three worlds is to us symbolic; that is, it is not a

25

map of the worldly geography. The maps can be found not only in the manuscripts but also on the walls of a large number of Buddhist temples, in most
cases in the sanctuary of the main Buddha image of each temple, signifying
the Buddhist values of the cosmos. It should be noted here again that depictions of the Traiphum space may vary. The shape of Chomphuthawip can
even be an oval or a triangle. 16 The differences reflect the various traditions or
schools of painting rather than the development of knowledge about the
earth.
But the Traiphum cosmography is only one among the famous subjects
depicted on these temple walls. There are Buddhological themes as well, such
as the story of the Buddha's life, the popular story of the Vessantara Jataka or
the tenth great birth of the Buddha, and many other stories of relics, Buddha
images, or various localities. In most cases, the cosmographic and Buddhological themes are on different walls of the same sanctuary.!' There is also a
manuscript which is so far the major source of pictures of these Buddhological stories. Dated from 1776, the manuscript has no title. But the one given
to it later, Samutphap traiphum chabap krung thonburi (Pictorial Manuscript of
the Traiphum: Thonburi Version), may mislead us into thinking that the pictures are all configurations of the Traiphum genre only. Though the pictures
of the three worlds constitute the main part of the manuscript, in fact not
only Buddhist narratives but different kinds of maps are also included.ts
The manuscript is a huge strip of thick, locally made folded paper. It consists of the Traiphum cosmography, the life of the Buddha, various Great
Jataka, and legends about Buddhism coming to "Suwannaphum," mainland
Southeast Asia today. It begins with the picture of the Mahanakhon Nipphan
(Great City of Nirvana)-the space of eternal salvation above and beyond the
three worlds of all beings-which is followed by pictures of various deities
r~nked down to the four guardians of the universe. Then, in the longest sectiOn of the manuscript, is shown every quarter of hell down to the lowest
sector. The description of the human world starts with the mythology of the
Buddha's life, followed by many Jataka stories and pictures of mythological
places and animals. The final section contains pictures of the Vessantara and
other great births of the Buddha. Pictures of the Jataka and mythological
stories are placed along a river symbol ( ~ -& ), which makes this part
of the picture look like a map. Strikingly, a number of the pictures in this
p~rt, between the story of the Vessantara and other births, undoubtedly constitute a geographical map. The river symbol might not only signify a geographical relationship in our sense but other kinds of relationships such as
genealogy or simply the sequence of the story as well.
If we look at the map closely (see Figure 2), panels (1) to (4) represent the
story of the Buddha's life, beginning with many Buddhological cities and

26

countries followed by a highlight of great moments before and after the
enlightenment. As the manuscript is basically a pictorial text of vari~us phum
(space, land), these moments are marked by places: the heavenly c1ty. of the
Buddha's father; the tree under which he was born; the place of enhghtenment; the seven trees where he relaxed and reconsidered the truth he found;
and many places he visited throughout his preaching career, including a
mountain of giants and demons and a town of animals.
Following the river symbol into panel (5), the locality adjacent to the Buddhological places is obviously Lanna, or northern Thailand to~ay. ~long ~he
top of panels (5), (6), and (7) are the Lao and Vietnamese reg10ns,_mclud1~g
Champa, an ancient kingdom defeated and lost to the Vietnamese m the sixteenth century. The bottoms of panels (7) and (8) are the Burmese and Mon
regions including Pagan, Moulmein, Syriam, Thaton, and Tavoy. The focus
of these pictures are the towns in Lanna and Siam including Ayudhya b~t not
Bangkok. Panel (8) shows the deltas of many rivers and the whole penmsula
from the Kra isthmus, which appears as a big island. Panels (9) and (10)
depict the sea where two renowned Buddhist sages in Southeast Asia, Phra
Phutthakhosachan and Phra Phutthathatta, were traveling to and from Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. Along the bottom of panels (8) to (10), a well-known
episode from the Ramayana appears. Rama orders his monkey-commander to
build a road across the sea to Longka, a town of demons which bears a similar
name to Ceylon in the Thai language-Langka. Panel (11) is Sri Lanka with
emphasis on the shrine of Buddha's relic. Some descriptions of places, travel
times, and distances are also given. Panel (12) is a mythological creature,
Anon Fish.
Michael Wright, in an article in a Thai magazine which is the only account
of this map, regarded the whole set of pictures as an old geographical map
from Ayudhya times (mid-fourteenth to mid-eighteenth centuries) th~t was,
perhaps, uninfluenced by foreign maps. 19 While noting that the locations of
many towns in Lanna and the central plain are generally correct, he was puzzled by two serious mistakes: the adjacency of the Buddha's places and Lanna
without Burma in between and the locations of India and Sri Lanka at opposite ends of the map. He also noticed that Ayudhya, as the center of the kingdom had no privileged status in this map. He did not say anything about the
mythological road of Rama or the relevance of the story of the Buddha's life
at the beginning of the map.
If one concedes that a map does not have to be a representation of the
earth's surface, but can depict other relations of space, it is easier to understand this set of pictures. Placed right after the end of the Vessantara story, it
is the story of the following birth as the Buddha. But to people in the region,

27

the meaningful story of Buddhism apart from the Buddha's life is the prospering of Buddhism in Suwannaphum, that is, mainland Southeast Asia. The
pictures establish the lineage of Buddhism in the region by claiming its origin
directly from Chomphuthawip and the Buddha's time on the one hand, and
its foundation by the two sages from the land of genuine Buddhism, Sri
Lanka, on the other. All these relationships are configured in the form of
related places. But while the space of Lanna, the Chao Phraya valley, the Burmese coastal towns, and Sri Lanka is based on a mapmaker's knowledge of
these parts of the earth's surface, the space of the Buddha's life, the two
prophets, and other mythical beings is completely imaginative. This set of
pictures is not designed to be a true geography of the region as Wright
expected. The artist deliberately put the map into a larger framework of
description, juxtaposing details about Chomphuthawip, Suwannaphum, and
Sri Lanka together in a single set of descriptions.
Thus the adjacency of Chomphuthawip and Lanna without Burma in
between is in no way a mistake. For the artist and his audience, it correctly
signifies the genesis of local Buddhism from its universal origin. There is no
need for correction or explanation (such as that in olden days there might
have been a special route between them) as Wright has provided. 2o The map
of the mainland and Southeast Asia as a whole, with the east at the top and
the west down at the bottom, is a single unit of a particular region where
Buddhism has prospered. The space of this unit is not imaginative or cosmographical, so a topographical map is in use here and the river symbol stands
for actual rivers. Sri Lanka is also concrete. 21 But the relationship between Sri
Lanka and Suwannaphum is symbolized by the story of the two sages. The
sea becomes symbolic enough to put some mythological stories in it. The
positions of Chomphuthawip and Sri Lanka at opposite ends of the map,
their distance from each other, and the incorrect directions in relation to
Southeast Asia are not geographical mistakes. Nor do the positions of Lanna
and Siam in the middle of the map signify their status as the center of the
Traiphum world. All of them are correctly put in their right places according
to this description about Buddhism in Suwannaphum, not according to the
earth's surface.
In all, this set of pictures tells a story similar to those on the walls of temples. Some parts of this set are exactly the same pictures of Buddhological
stories which can be found elsewhere-the mid-ocean meeting between the
two Buddhist sages, for example, and the Buddha's great departure, the
moment when he abandoned his worldly life. 22 A similar description about
the connection between Lanna and the Buddha's lifetime can be found in
many local Buddhist legends, or Tamnan. Some historians have taken it as an

28

Chapter One

account of actual geography in order to work out the origins of the Tai people. But it has been argued more convincingly that it is .an idealized ge~gra­
phy, the "Tamnan geography." 23 So the whole set of p1ctures under dlscussion is a "Tamnan Map," a relation of space according to a Tamnan story,
.
though a significant unit in the set is a map in our modern sense.
Our discussion so far has shown different kinds of indigenous conceptions
of space and maps before the coming of modern geography. The prevalence
of cosmography was beyond doubt, but various spatial conceptions existed
together and produced complex knowledge, practices, and maps. Most of
these spaces were conceptually sacralized by religious concepts and symbolism. In pilgrimage, for instance, "the faithful impart unquestioned truthfulness not only to the conceptions of ultimate reality and its symbols, but also
to those dimensions of physical space which are associated with meaningful
24
symbols and which are proper settings for valued religious actions." Or
we can say that space was conceived and made meaningful by systems. of
sacred entities. These entities mediated between space and human, creatmg
particular kinds of imagined space. Consequently, the character of such
space was determined by the relationships of sacred entities according to a
belief-for instance, the hierarchical thirty-seven nat and the thirty-two myo,
the twelve Buddhist shrines and the idea of pilgrimage, the Tamnan geography and its myth-ritual story. To understand the space and the map,
one has to understand its concept (its grammar) and its symbolism (its
morphemes).
Despite all these sacred topographies, the map of the profane earth's surface
should not be regarded as nonexistent. The map of mainland Southeast Asia
in the Tamnan Map is evidence. Chandler tells us that in the case of Cambodia there are many maps of small localities such as villages and travel routes,
but there are only a few specimens of what he calls a national map. He
attributes this to the Cambodian people's lack of interregional life and to the
sporadic, isolated pattern of Cambodian villages. 25 In the case of Siam, however, the premodern maps of small localities and routes are rare, perhaps due
to the lack of interest in this subject. (If this is true, perhaps plenty of them
are yet to be discovered.) Figure 3 is a portion of a strip map of the eas.tern
bank of Songkhla Lagoon, latitude 7-8 degrees north, on the Gulf of S1am.
Dated between 1680 and 1699, the whole area is consecutively portrayed in
terms of sixty-three temples. 26 As a study of it has noted, the landscape was
read, that is, conceived and marked, by sacred sites which made the topography meaningful. 27 But the sacred shrines depicted here were not a symbolic
representation of a belief system. They represented the existence of the localities in which they resided. The spatial unit in this map was not a cosmo-

29

graphic or imaginary world of any kind. It was a map of the profane earth's
surface. It should be recalled that a route map or diagram similar to a treasure
map was an early form of ancient map in every culture. This sort of diagram
of a piece of the earth was certainly known to the indigenous people of Siam
as well.
There is another fascinating map in the Thonburi version of the Traiphum
pictorial manuscript: a coastal map from Korea to Arabia which was incorporated into the description of the human world in the Traiphum scheme (see
Figure 4). 28 In this map, all the coasts are lined up along the bottom part of
the map and all the seas are in the upper part. It begins with Korea and Japan
situated in the sea, followed by the Chinese coast opposite Taiwan rightward
to Canton (panel 1). Then the Vietnamese coast appears like a peninsula jutting into the sea with the mouth of the Mekhong River at its peak and the
coast along the Gulf of Siam in a trough (panel 2). At the bottom of panel
(3), Ayudhya appears as the biggest city in the gulf. The Malay peninsula,
like the Vietnamese, juts upward (panel 4). At the bottom of this bay are the
Mon and Burmese towns (panelS). Apart from these identifications, none of
the toponyms on the supposed Indian coasts (panels S-6) can be identified
with names we know, except one in the middle of the coast of panel (6)
whose name is "Roam Noi" (Little Rome). In the seas, there are many
islands with the same somewhat oval shape. Many of these islands can be
identified, such as Japan, Taiwan, Sichang (in the Gulf of Siam), the Andamans, and Sri Lanka. In panel (1) and half of (2), the top of the map is the
east. For the rest of the map, the top is the south; all the coasts northward are
at the bottom, and the east is on the left and the west on the right.
Wright suggests that the Coastal Map follows the Chinese tradition. Terwiel argues that the seventeenth-century European map was "the chief
source of inspiration for this map." 29 Wenk suggests that it is a Traiphum
cosmographic chart, since it is part of the manuscript. Supporting Wenk's
analysis, Terwiel considers it in that light but with hesitation:
[It is] an example of the Thai capacity to absorb detailed new information and
adjust it to fit in with Traiphum cosmographical ideas .... [It] is not a geographical work in the strict sense of the word: many coasts twist unrealistically
in direction, the relative proportions of countries are wrong and there is no
grid. Many islands have been placed in a blatantly false location .... The conclusion that the creators of the chart were more interested in cosmography than
in geography is amply supported by such palpable divergence from reality. The
chart may be regarded as an attempt to depict a large part of the coastline of the
Traiphum's Southern continent, together with a selected assortment of its five
hundred islands." Jo

It would be wrong, however, to assume that knowledge of the earth's surface was unknown until the Europeans came, or that the new information
can be understood only through the Traiphum cosmographic ideas. It is also
a mistake to dismiss indigenous knowledge on the basis that it is not accurate
according to our scientific criteria. The Traiphum earth and the geographical
earth are different, but related, kinds of space operating in different domains
of human conception and practice. The incorporation of the Coastal Map
into the description of the Traiphum space, like the map of mainland Southeast Asia in the Tamnan Map, makes it a single unit in the overall cosmographic narrative. Yet in itself it was actually a geographical map of the
earth's surface, not a cosmographic one. Considering specifically this Coastal
Map, it had many characteristics more similar to the Chinese tradition of
coastal charts than to the European map. Although some information might
have come from European sources, the basic pattern of this map seems to
derive from the Chinese model.J 1 The making of coastal charts was a tradition among the Chinese dating back to the early Christian era, a tradition
which then gave way to European mapping through the influence of the
Jesuits only around the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Among the
charts left to us, some were "narrow-strip-maps in which the coast, or a long
stretch of the coast, is represented as running in a horizontal direction from
right to left irrespective of its true direction." 32 The basic directions were
toward the land or outward to the sea, and the land was along the top or the
bottom of the maps. The scale was uneven. Indeed, one might say there was

no scaling method in the making of these maps.
The Chinese were among the earliest travelers in the Far East, Southeast
Asia, and beyond. They provided information about places they had visited
or heard about for later native maps. Maps of this region had been produced
33
and names of places entered in their records since the early Christian era. So
it is not surprising that details about places along the South China Sea on the
way to the Indian coasts were richer than for the Arab and European world.
Nonetheless, it is difficult to say at this stage how strong the Chinese influence was on Siamese mapmaking or how far the Siamese had localized the
Chinese tradition. To produce a map, the creator might have acquired information from various sources, including European ones, probably without
having direct experience of the coasts. The names, distances, or even locations could even have come from hearsay and mythical stories about various
places without the scientific criteria we use today.
The last map to be discussed here is the so-called Strategic Map of King
Rama I (see Figure 5). It is said to be the oldest map in ThailandY This statement is obviously wrong if we regard the indigenous charts discussed so far

Indigenous Space and Ancient Maps

31

as maps as well. The Strategic Map is, however, free of all religious codings,
thus illustrating the indigenous knowledge of the profane earth. It is a local
map, and the earth's surface it covers is the former Lao region which is northeastern Thailand today. This map has been studied by Victor Kennedy, who
ex~~ines the one existing copy, a reproduction from the period of King
VaJiravudh, Rama VI of Bangkok (r. 1910-1925). Investigating the details of
the map, he concludes that it is the map for Siamese troops fighting in the
~ar against Vientiane in 1827. But it is likely that the original of this map is
Itself a copy of an older one, with modifications made specifically for military
purposes. 35
The map shows travel routes from Bangkok to the northeast, mostly along
the rivers but including mountains, rivers, fortresses, and towns along the
way. The distance between two places was measured in terms of the time it
took to travel from one point to another. In his attempt to evaluate its accuracy according to the modern map, Kennedy finds many shortcomings. Locations of many places are wrong. There is no scale. Distances are unreliable.
Yet some of these anomalies are the clues to his findings-namely, that some
areas are disproportionately enlarged with more details than others because
they were important to the 1827 operation.
Despite the anomalies, the space of this map is made meaningful, and can
be imagined, not in terms of sacred entities but in terms of places the travelers
experienced along the routes on the earth's surface. It is obviously not a map
of sacred topography nor a cosmographic plan. It is a map of a piece of the
earth's surface similar to a modern map. But unlike a modern map, it does
not yet show how such a piece of the earth's surface relates to, or is situated
on, the globe. There is no reference to the larger earth's surface, such as latitude and longitude lines, or the relation of this territory to nearby kingdoms
in terms of boundaries. Such a relationship was probably not a matter of concern for a local map, since the knowledge about the whole planet earth
belonged to the cosmology. The isolation of a piece of the earth's surface
from the entire globe might be compared to the isolation of the earth from
the whole galaxy in our minds today. In other words, the classification of a
local geography and the whole globe as separate categories in the indigenous
knowledge about space is comparable to the separate classification in modern
science today of geography and astronomy or astrophysics.
To return to the Tamnan Map and the Coastal Map in the light of this
Strategic Map, what may be regarded as errors, "palpable divergence from
reality" in Terwiel's eyes, and distortions might be due to indigenous methods of mapmaking and travel data. These maps were made without the scientific criteria and standards of reliability we use today. But the mapmakers

Chapter One

Indigenous Space and Ancient Maps

33

32
might have had their own methods and standards. In the Tamnan Map, it
seems that the river routes and the information about travel along them from
north to south were the major data it recorded. The whole of mainland
Southeast Asia was known mostly by towns and rivers or places along them.
Hence the vast inland area between the Chao Phraya valley and the Mekhong
River was almost nonexistent, whereas the narrow strips of land where the
four rivers flow out to the Gulf of Siam were enlarged. Furthermore, traveling along each river, travelers might have had difficulty in distinguishing the
different latitudinal positions of the Irrawaddy and Chao Phraya deltas. So
they appeared on the same level, or the towns in the Irrawaddy delta seemed
to be more southward than they should have been. Perhaps because of the
perspective of river travelers, all of them were thought to be parallel: In .the
maps of mainland Southeast Asia made by Europeans before the mid-mneteenth century-when none of them had actually surveyed the inland areas
and had to rely on the information of native people-all the major rivers from
Burma to the Vietnamese coast also appear somewhat parallel.
Maritime travel along the coasts from China to India without cross-checking by land travel might have produced information which was affected
navigational factors, seasonal weather and wind, swells, and ~o forth. This
information plus myths or hearsay might account for the crudity of a coastal
map which could plot positions along the coasts and distances between them
in terms of travel time fairly well but failed to obtain data about the land
along the sea. Distortions or anomalies may be clues leading us to ~isc~rn particular sources of information, purposes, or techniques of each mdigenous
map, as Kennedy did in the case of the Strategic Map. In contrast :~ the
approach taken by many studies, these anomalies must be regarded positiVely
as traces leading us to understand the methods or concepti~ns ~ehi~d seve~al
features of the maps. We should not simply evaluate their scientific ment.
Nor should these anomalies be regarded as evidence that such a map had
nothing to do with the geography of the earth's surface, and thus belonged

b!

to the cosmographic scheme.
In comparing several kinds of indigenous map, one distinction between a
depiction of imaginary space and a map of the material space emerges: :he
measurement of distance between places. Although there are many numencal
values in the Traiphum and Buddhological maps, they are symbolic figures of
various worlds, ideal places, descriptions of beings, or symbolic quantities of
sacred objects. Many of them can be calculated by arithmatic formulas, such
as the size of the earth and other levels or the sizes and distances between the
seven rings of mountains and oceans. 36 Only in the maps of a piece of the
earth's surface are the details of time-distance between many places men-

tioned. In the Strategic Map, for example, the distance in terms of travel time
is marked by lines bet~een two places and a few words, such as wannung,
songkhun (a day, two mghts), close to each line. This time-distance appears in
the Tamnan Map as well, where the distances between many places on the
big island, righ~ of the Menam delta, are marked by words such as thanghawan (five-day distance). In the Coastal Map, there are also plenty of lines
bet"":een places. The distance is measured in yot (yochana in Sanskrit), about
16. kilometers. It is also the unit of distance used in the Traiphum, but it is
qmte .clear that the figures in these maps are distances measured by human
expenence, perhaps calculated from travel time as well.

The Coexistence of Different Concepts of Space
The Traiphum cosmography and other kinds of sacred topography could
hav: been imagined in terms other than the geographical "reality" with
which we are familiar. Their space is religious or imaginative to us-hence a
space .that does not necessarily correspond to the earth's surface. The reality,
meanmg, and message expressed through these spatial relations have nothing
to do with our worldly geography. As a result, there might be an indefinite
number of different depictions of the same message. For many centuries, the
concept of the three worlds has inspired artists from modern schools as well
as traditi~nal ones. 37 The knowledge of local geography or certain parts of
t~e eart~ s s.urface, on the other hand, was another kind of spatial conceptiOn. It IS neither symbolic nor sacred.
We may say there were several discourses on space existing in the field of
prem~dern geographical knowledge. Each of them operated in a certain
domam of human affairs and everyday life. In other words, there were terrai~s ~f ~nowledge .within which particular conceptions operated; beyond
thetr. hm~ts, other buds of knowledge came into force. The knowledge of
certam villages and towns might have been operating at local levels. The
space of the Strategic Map or the Coastal Map might have had an effect on
commanders of t:oops and ~hinese merchants. Yet such knowledge might
have been called mto operation only in a military exercise, in administrative
works, or for maritime trade. But when people thought or talked about
Si~m, the kingdom of Vientiane, or China, another kind of spatial conception
mtght have come to mind. And when they thought or talked about the earth
the w_orld. they li~ed in, the pictures of the Traiphum might have preoccupied thetr mmds. Like many other concepts in human life today and yesterday, shifts from one kind of knowledge to another or from one domain of
spatial conception to another are not uncommon.

34

Chapter One

In speaking of "Siam," therefore, various conceptions of Siam might be at
work. A striking illustration of this occurred in the second quarter of the
nineteenth century-the period in which the Siamese elite were introduced to
Western geographical knowledge and maps, and in which there were signs of
changes in the Siamese view of the world. Frederick A. Neale tells a fascinating story about a Siamese court discourse on the map of "Siam." One day,
Neale reports, the Siamese king told the European visitors about a conflict
between Siam and Burma regarding a boundary question. The king then
showed a picture of the two kingdoms, said to have been drawn by his prime
minister to illustrate the Siamese talent in geography and brilliance in painting. With the eyes and mind of a civilized Englishman, Neale gives a threepage description of the map and his feelings, an account which deserves a
lengthy quote together with a picture from his book (see Figure 6):
We were, however, very nearly outraging all propriety by bursting into fits of
laughter, and very painful was the curb we were obliged to wear to restrain our
merriment. The inclination to smile, too visibly depicted in our faces to be mistaken, was, happily, by His Majesty, construed into delight and admiration at
the beautiful work of art set before us to dazzle our eyes with its excessive brilliancy of colour. The map was about three feet by two; in the center was a
patch of red, about eighteen inches long by ten broad; above it was a patch of
green, about ten inches long by three wide. On the whole space occupied by
the red was pasted a singular looking figure, cut out of silver paper, with a
pitch-fork in one hand and an orange in the other: there was a crown on the
head, and spurs on the heels, and the legs, which were of miserably thin dimensions, met sympathetically at the knees, and this cadaverous looking creature
was meant to represent the bloated piece of humanity seated before us, indicating that so vast were his strength and power that it extended from one end of
his dominions to the other. In the little patch of green, a small Indian-ink figure, consisting of a little dot for the head, a large dot for the body, and four
scratches of the pen to represent the legs and arms, was intended for the
wretched Tharawaddy, the then King of Burmah. A legion of little imps, in
very many different attitudes, were dancing about his dominions, and these
hieroglyphics were to show to the uninitiated in what a troubled and disturbed
state the Burmese empire was, and what an insignificant personage, in his own
dominions, was the Burman king. Betwixt the green and the red, there was a
broad black stripe, an indisputable boundary line; and on the red side of the
black stripe, a little curved thin line drawn with ink, to indicate the territory
laid claim to by the Birmans but disputed by the Siamese; the rest of the map
was all blue, and on this blue, which was the ocean, all round the red or Siamese territory vilely painted ships were represented sailing to and fro, some
with the masts towards the land, the others evidently bottom up, at least their

Indigenous Space and Ancient Maps

35

masts pointed in the wrong direction. The poor Burmese had not even so much
as a boat to display. Having, of course, acquiesced in all that His Majesty said,
and given utterance to exclamations of surprise in mute show, like so many ballet dancers, the old king seemed to be quite pleased and delighted, and ordering
the map to be carried away indulged in a confidential chuckle for a few
seconds. 38
Probably this description of the event was colored, and Neale's picture
showed the draftsman's ignorance of Siamese painting. But from the information given, we can imagine what the map looked like. If we replace the
Siamese creature in the big square with the figure of a thewada, a heavenly
deity in traditional Thai art, who must have a pointed crown, the chada or
mongkut, and replace the long fork and orange with a short three-pronged
sword, the tri, and a conch, the sang, respectively, the figure in the domain of
Siam would be a heavenly deity. Hence Siam was the celestial domain. In
contrast, Burma was the domain of demons, whose typical representation is
similar to what Neale described. The court must not be misrepresented as
knowing nothing of geography apart from the Traiphum space. Different
conceptions of space were at work in different situations or for different purposes. In this case, the discourse on the existence of the two kingdoms was
represented in the cosmographic fashion. To one's great surprise, however,
the boundary question could be expressed in this nongeographic map.
In studies on the change of the Siamese worldview in the late nineteenth
century, two conclusions are usually presented. First, the transition was
rather a smooth process of westernization, thanks to the enlightened Siamese
elite and, to a lesser extent, the contribution of hardworking missionaries.
Confrontations with the indigenous knowledge are rarely mentioned and
never serious. Second, since most studies tend to overemphasize the importance of the Traiphum cosmography while ignoring other spatial conceptions, it seems that the transformation was a shift from the Traiphum concept to modern geography. Moreover, there is no study on the shift of
geographical knowledge per se. The changes of worldview are always subsumed within the context of the introduction of Western science in general.
The coming of modern geography and astronomy confronted not only the
Traiphum cosmos, though that was one of the most turbulent arenas. It also
found counterparts in the indigenous conceptions of local geography, boundaries, land plots, statehood, and more. Perhaps confrontations occurred in
every arena of matching conception and practice: in the boundary marking,
for example, and in the concept of a realm which was the basis of indigenous
interstate relations.
Space itself has no meaning if human beings have not encountered and

and generated certain practices. Modern geography was not s1mp Y new a a

The Coming of a New Geography

AROUND THE SAME TIME that the Siamese court presented foreign visitors with
the picture of Siam as a celestial domain, the knowledge that Siam was one
among many countries on earth was widespread. Contacts with the Europeans and other neighbors had been growing rapidly through trade. 1 By the
early nineteenth century, names of the European and Asian countries were
mentioned in an official inscription and a well-known work of literature. 2

Two Earths, Same Space: The Advent ofModern Earth
We know more about the Siamese and their interest in Western astronomy
and geography from the 1830s onward. It was a famous topic in most missionary memoirs, although their contributions to the modernization in Siam
may be overrated. John Taylor Jones, one of the earliest missionaries in Siam,
who arrived in 1833 with copies of the map of the world, tells about a monk
who asked for an English map. 3 Jones, with two other well-known missionaries in Siam at the time, Bradley and House, also tells us that in some scientific experiments they organized for members of the Siamese elite, they
showed their audiences a globe, a model of the solar system, and planetary
movements. 4 Among the Siamese elite, Mongkut, who later became King
Rama IV (r. 1851-1868), was said to have abandoned the Traiphum cosmology before 1836. He had a globe, a chart calculating the coming eclipse, and
maps in his room, and he once asked these missionaries innumerable questions about the earth. 5 Bradley tells us that Mongkut was impressed by
a book, Almanac and Astronomy, written in 1843 by the missionary Jesse
Caswell to counter the Siamese belief in the Traiphum. It spread among
Mongkut's disciples very quickly. 6
In an evening conversation among Mongkut and his men in the mid-

37

38

Chapter Two

1840s, a high-ranking nobleman told Mongkut that he eventually accepted
the idea that the earth was spherical after reading Caswell's book. But
Mongkut claimed that he himself had already held such a view fifteen years
before-that is, before the appearance of the American missionaries in Siam.
Another nobleman, however, rejected the idea and said he would never be
convinced. 7 These exchanges show us at least two things. First, the question
of the earth's shape had been receiving considerable attention from intellectuals: the issue was still lively and unsettled. Second, Mongkut was so firm in
his belief in a spherical earth that he claimed to have abandoned the idea of a
flat earth long ago in the remoteness of his past. His claim, even an exaggerated one, implied how outdated the traditional conviction was and how modern he himself had been. The stubborn believer in a flat earth, who appears in
the same scene, attests to the resilience of the traditional conception of the
earth. These stories indicate that certain sections of the Siamese elite already
had a passing familiarity with Western geographical knowledge. They welcomed the new knowledge and were anxious to acquire it. Yet there is no
doubt that the missionaries also encountered firm believers in the Traiphum
cosmography.
Mongkut's interest in astronomy and modern geography began in the
early years of his monkhood, especially because of his love for calculations of
planetary movements. His understanding of the earth, compared to his contemporaries, seems pretty advanced. He once showed how important the scientific earth was in his view when he wrote a letter in reply to Bradley's
explanation of the Creator and the Bible's role in civilization. He charged
that the Bible was full of mistakes about the earth and nature, particularly the
belief in the six-day Creation. If the Bible is the origin of civilization, he challenged, why does it not say anything at all about how to measure latitude and
longitude? 8 Perhaps his love of calculating coordinates on the earth's surface
was at times extravagant. Even before he became king, he wrote a letter to
one of his American friends; the letter was written from "a place of sea surface 13°26 'N. latitude and 101°3 'E. longitude in the Gulf of Siam, 18th
November Anbo [sic] Christi, 1849." 9
When he became king he urged his royal relatives to have a European-style
education. Modern geography and astronomy were among the lessons given
by the missionaries. 10 Perhaps the status of geography in his mind can be
summed up by his own verdict in a letter to Sir John Bowring, a prominent
British diplomat of that time, talking about the account of an Ayudhyan
envoy to France in the late seventeenth century. He commented that the
account was unconvincing since it was "opposed to geographical knowledge
which is the true facts about the earth." 11 Geography and astronomy

The Coming ofa New Geography

39

appeared to be the first among the Western sciences he mentioned when he
talked about the truth or wonderful science from the West.t2
To be s~re, Mongkut's case is significant because he was a leading figure
whose attitudes toward the new sciences and geography were shared by
others. But the disbelief in modern geography was not easily given up. Even
the Siamese interpreter in the mission to Queen Victoria's court in 1857
:Vho was fluent in English and familiar with Western ideas, asked in his poet:
1cal account of his journey:
Why the sun does set in the sea?
Also at dawn, it does rise up from the sea.
Or is it true, as the English think,
That the shape of the earth is like an orange?
And does the sun, standing still, never move?
Amusingly, the earth itself rotates,
Even the three worlds are so huge.
How dull I am not to understand how it can be.t3

The Traiphum's earth had been too deeply entrenched to be abandoned. As
one historian has observed, the shift occurred at a glacial pace. Indeed, that
conception has survived in certain circles of social life, in traditionally rooted
cultural life, such as the Buddhist order, rituals, religious festivals, and in
what was later identified as popular culture, even to the present time.t4 A
close scrutiny of the circumstances in which the shift took place will lead us
to the forces which affected the establishment of modern geography. As it
turns out, it was not a gradual, smooth diffusion of knowledge at all.
The quest for modern geography and other Western sciences took place in
the same period as the Buddhist reform in the mid-nineteenth century, which
resulted in the birth of a new sect in Siamese Theravada Buddhism. Both the
reform and the quest for modern science were led by the same peopleMongkut and his disciples-from the early 1820s when he was a monk. In
fact we can say that these were two trends of the same political and intellectual m~vement which questioned the purity and validity of the sangha, the
Buddhist order, as it was practiced in Siam at the time.
Like other Buddhist reformations, the true Buddhism and sangha could be
found in orthodoxy-the Pali Tripitaka, not the commentaries or exegesesand the strict discipline of the sangha was believed to have been laid down
since the Buddha's time. In the spirit of Mongkut's movement, nonetheless,
true Buddhism was supposed to refrain from worldly matters and confine
itself to spiritual and moral affairs. They believed that those alleged Buddhist
doctrines which were concerned with cosmography were in fact contami-

40

Chapter Two

nated by other false beliefs such as Brahmanism. Thus they distinguished
worldly matters and spiritual affairs from each other, though they were
related. They believed that Buddhism was the truth of the latter whereas
Western science was the truth of the former. Thus they openly welcomed
Western science more than any other group in Siam-so much so, in fact,
that missionaries regarded this Buddhist orthodoxy movement as the progressive faction in Siam. 15
This so-called progressive faction eventually came to power in 1851, and
from that moment Siam changed dramatically toward modernization. The
fact that the Siamese propagators of Western science now also had political
power in their hands has already been regarded as a major reason for the
smooth transition toward modernization and rapid diffusion of Western
knowledge. Moreover, it is usually argued that the imperialist advances in
Burma and China had alarmed Siam into urgent acquisition of the more influential and superior Western knowledge. The Mongkut factor and the imperialist victory meant that from now on not only did Western knowledge
expand on its own merit but it was also backed by extra-epistemological
power which gained it a stronghold in the society and made it all the more
influential.
But the impact of Mongkut's religious movement, his royal authority, and
the showdown with the Western powers did not automatically decide the
outcome of confrontation between Western cosmography and the indigenous
one. The two beliefs continued to struggle overtly throughout the reign in
various ways. In 1866, for example, Bradley published a series of articles
about the earth. It was still a lively and interesting subject for his readers, and
his articles represented the only detailed explanation about the earth at the
time. Starting from observable verifications of the sphericity of the earth, he
also gave his readers a general topographical account: its size, surface composition, the names and locations of oceans and lands, the atmospheric zones,
and so forth. 16 (Bradley's newspaper stopped printing that year, unfortunately, when Eskimos were the subject.) Bradley tended to use the new
knowledge as a spearhead to penetrate traditional belief, targeting the faith in
Buddhism in particular. A letter from Mongkut joined Bradley's attempt to
destabilize the traditional view of the cosmos. But Mongkut also challenged
17
the Bible in the same letter on the same ground.
Only a year later, in 1867, one of the highest-ranking nobles in Siam,
Chaophraya Thiphakorawong (hereafter Thiphakorawong), published a
book titled Kitchanukit, a polemic against the traditional cosmography as well
as Christianity. 18 Following the epistemological tendency of Mongkut's
movement, the book was typical in its concept of the distinction between the

The Coming ofa New Geography

41

worldly and the religious domains, whose truth can be found in Western science and Buddhism respectivelyY He reaffirmed the truthfulness of Buddhism and argued against any contrary doctrines, especially criticism from the
missionaries. 20 But in doing so, he had to deprive Buddhism of any relevance
to the truth of the natural world: he had to make it the champion of morals
and ethics alone.
In the first two-fifths of the book he gave his instruction on modern geography and astronomy as aspects of the true knowledge of the natural world.
The question of the earth's shape became a focal point of confrontation in the
text where the truth of the indigenous knowledge, especially Buddhist cosmology, was attestable in the light of the Western scheme. 21 He described the
earth as a planet in the solar system with so firm a conviction of its sphericity
that he could explain its origin on the one hand and polemically question
those who believed in a flat earth on the other. In arguing how we can know
that the earth is not flat, he cited observable phenomena and the story of Columbus's discovery of the New World, both of which could be found in Bradley's newspaper. 22 In doing this, he was aware that the Traiphum cosmography had become the target of his attack and that the authority of the Buddha
could be cast in doubt since he was said to know every truth with infallibility. Not only could Thiphakorawong manage to avoid becoming a heretic,
but by his argument he could go so far as to say: "One who thinks that the
earth is flat is a follower of those who believe in God the Creator. For one
who believes that the earth is spherical is following the Buddha's words
about what is natural."23
His method of escape from the dilemma became typical for the modern
Buddhist Thai whose faith in Buddhism is unshaken while objective knowledge of Western science is equally upheld. Apart from segregating the two
domains of life, Thiphakorawong confirmed that the Buddha knew the truth
of the earth, but the Buddha was also aware that what he knew was in conflict with people's belief. If the Buddha had raised this question, Thiphakorawong explained, people would have been obsessed with this topic and
neglected the path to salvation. That is to say, it was a futile topic, meaningless to preach, worthless to challenge. He blamed old gurus of later generations for incorporating this subject into the Buddhist corpus while the best
they could do was rely on those Brahmanic doctrines and some Pali exegeses
which were ignorant of the truth. 24 It is clear that Thiphakorawong had no
hesitation in accusing traditional doctrines of being contaminated by
Brahmanism while promoting geography of the new kind with the approval
of true Buddhism.
Modern geography appears to be a new knowledge for dealing with any

Chapter Two

42

question about space. This was not without difficulty. The author must
explain, for example, a story in the Buddha's life about his trip to give a sermon to his mother in Dawadung, a level of heaven according to the
Traiphum cosmos. Thiphakorawong concedes that it might be true. But that
was not contradictory to the true geographical knowledge since, for him,
25
Dawadung might be on another spherical planetary body far away. The
apparent conflict between the truth of the Buddha's life story and modern science is resolved fantastically and, to him, consistently.
Kitchanukit is a comprehensive testimony of the Siamese response to the
influence of Western cosmographic concepts. In a sense, this epistemological
strategy was a resolution to reconcile the conflicting sets of knowledge,
regardless of any logical inconsistency in the hybrid. At the same time it was
a thrust against the dominant indigenous cosmology. As Thiphakorawong
stated in the introduction of his book, he wanted it to be read among the
26
younger generation, replacing the "useless" books in circulation.
With power in its hands, nonetheless, the ideological movement which
tried to reconcile indigenous and Western knowledge had to struggle harder
against the indigenous beliefs on the one hand and Christianity on the other.
Mongkut himself had struggled throughout his life for his ideological hybrid
which favored the Western sciences but at the same time championed Buddhism. In fact, the incident which ultimately cost him his life, the observation of the 1868 full eclipse at Wako, was a painful, disruptive moment of the
confrontation of knowledge. It was indeed an event symbolic of epistemological struggle in many respects. The seemingly peaceful coexistence of the two
knowledges of space was in fact a war of position, to use a Gramscian term,
eventually to acquire hegemony.

Breakthrough: Astronomy via Astrology
In addition to his love for the calculation of coordinates on the earth's surface, Mongkut loved calculating planetary movements. He had developed his
expertise primarily from the indigenous astrology which he had certainly
learned in his monastic years. Mongkut-leader of the progressive faction, of
the new Buddhist movement, and of westernization in Siam-was in fact an
ardent student of traditional astrology. At the same time, however, he also
developed his acquaintance with Western astronomy and mathematics from
texts in English. 27
As one renowned astrologer in Thailand today remarks, Mongkut's contributions to astrology were enormous. He replaced the horoscope of Bangkok,
which was inscribed on a gold plate and buried under the shrine of the city

The Coming ofa New Geography

43

pillar, when he found that it would have caused disaster in his reign because it
conflicted with his own horoscope. 28 He often demonstrated his expertise in
astrology in his royal proclamations. One of his contributions to Thai astrology was his calculation of the new Thai calendar. He even charged that the
court astrologers never reexamined the accuracy of their calculations and in
fact never questioned or even understood their astrological treatise. Hence
the official calendar was messy: the Buddhist holy days in the calendar were
seriously miscalculated and the times for auspicious moments were incorrect.
His arguments in this case were undoubtedly the best illustration of his mastery of astrology. 29
Apart from that, at every Thai new year's day in mid-April, called
Songkran, the court would make an official announcement informing the
public of the auspicious times for that year. The proclamation also inaugurated the coming year by announcing the exact time and duration of each of
the twelve constellations of the zodiac, details of coming eclipses, important
celestial phenomena, good days for auspicious occasions, bad days to be
avoided, and so on. 30 Throughout his reign, Mongkut wrote this annual
announcement and did the calculations himself. Sometimes he made comments on astrological knowledge, as in his contention about how to forecast
the amount of rainfall for the coming year. Previously this had been done by
the court astrologers in terms of the number of the naga which would provide rain and the predicted amount of rainfall in various parts of the
Traiphum cosmos such as the heavenly forest, the seven rings of mountains
and oceans, the human continent, and so forth. Mongkut disregarded these
practices as unreliable. 31
In the astrology Mongkut practiced, his interest was confined to the calculations of planetary movements, not the fortune-telling aspect of traditional
astrology. He questioned the official calendar because he found inaccuracies in
the calculation of the solar and lunar orbits. The Songkran announcement
each year was full of details of the position of the earth in reference to the
positions of stars in each constellation, the times the earth moved in and out
of each constellation, the waxing and waning of the moon, and the forecast
of eclipses. He also enjoyed observing the activities of other celestial phenomena such as comets, sunspots, and other planetary orbits.
Nonetheless, he never denounced fortune-telling. He simply divorced it
from the science of celestial calculation. In his view, the celestial phenomena
had no effect on human affairs. This idea was certainly different from the
notions entertained by his contemporary astrologers. Twice in 1858 and 1861
when comets came, he warned against rumors of epidemics, disasters, wars,
or bad omens. The same comet, he argued, had been seen in Europe before

44

Chapter Two

and thus was not a specific omen for Bangkok; moreover, human beings
could calculate the coming of a comet in advance. 32 He made it clear when
the moon and Saturn were aligned in 1868 and the sun and Mercury were
aligned in 1861-phenomena regarded as bad omens in the astrological view
-that sometimes those bodies orbited to the same point and therefore one
must be hidden from our sight. They were natural phenomena: 33 "The celestial phenomena can be observed and calculated in advance. So, whatever
strangeness may be seen in the sky should not be taken as any reason for
fright. The causes [of such strange phenomena] have already been ascertained."34 Moreover, the earth in his view was nothing but a planet like other
stars. The earth's surface was full of countries, and Siam was merely one of
them. In his forecast of eclipses, he sometimes announced that they would be
seen in the human world but not in Siam; sometimes he gave precise positions on earth in terms of the coordinates that offered the best view of
eclipses. His earth was obviously a global planet in the solar system.
This new cosmology was a departure from indigenous astrology. His royal
authority might have precluded any danger of attack and provided a stronghold for his intellectual thrust, but it in no way toppled the establishment.
On several occasions, when he argued with Bradley, in the latter's newspaper, about science and religion, he repudiated his fellow elite-senior monks,
the patriarch, even his cousin, the previous king, for their ignorance regarding the earth and the sky. Even senior Burmese monks did not escape his
attack for their cosmologic worldview. 35 It is not clear, however, how the
astrologers at that time reacted to the challenge of the new worldview from
within. In any case, Mongkut continued his struggle with confidence and an
antagonistic attitude toward the court astrologers-most of whom were,
ironically, like him, ex-monks who had learned their expertise in monasteries. The struggle was, by all means, serious to the end of his life.
Once, in a forecast of a lunar eclipse, he emphasized that it was calculated
by the king, not the astrologers. 36 The reason for this emphasis was given on
another occasion. When there were no details of eclipses in the Songkran
announcement of 1866, he wrote: "There is a lot of work to do, and no time
for calculation, but if we let the astrologers do it, it would be crude and unreliable."37 Sometimes he labeled his adversaries as hon sumsam, that is, careless
astrologers. 38 Some monks and ex-monks who did the calendrical calculation
were scornfully called then, sham monks. He went further by classifying then
into three types: ngomthen, those who were interested in nothing but eating
and sleeping; rayamthen, those who were busy with women or other
improper affairs; and laithen, ignorant monks who knew little of anything
but curried favor with others. It was the last category who became the calen-

The Coming of a New Geography

45

dar officials of the court. 39 Mongkut used these terms whenever he attacked
the practices of astrologers and monks, including their superficial knowledge
of time measurement. 4o
The observation of the full solar eclipse at Wako in 1868 was the climax of
his struggle. The forecast of the event was announced on Songkran that year
without any detail because Mongkut had not had enough time for calculation. In August an official announcement was made. He calculated the exact
time of the eclipse in the Thai system of time measurement (mong, baht) and
the precise duration of the full eclipse, which was one baht or, as he said, "six
minutes mechanic clock." 41 But the full eclipse would be seen only along a
certain belt on the earth, which happened to cross the Kra isthmus at "longitude 99 ongsa, 40 lipda, 20 philipda, calculated from Greenwich, that is, only
49 lipda and 40 philip. west of Bangkok [and] latitude khipthuwi 11 ongsa, 41
lipda, and 40 philip. north, which is 2 ongsa, 3 lipda, 29 philip. south of
Bangkok." 42 The units of measurement were the Thai versions of degrees,
minutes, and seconds respectively. But the method of measuring in terms of
coordinates on the earth's surface was undoubtedly Western. One study on
this issue suggests that in his calculation Mongkut consulted an unorthodox
doctrine-the Saram, one of the two Mon treatises for planetary calculation
known in Siam-as well as Western texts. 43
Damrong tells us that according to astrological knowledge prevailing in
Siam, there could be a full lunar eclipse but there had never been a full solar
eclipse and it was probably impossible. Therefore, most astrologers at that
time did not believe Mongkut's forecast because of its unorthodoxy. 44
Damrong's retrospective explanation is exaggerated. A full solar eclipse is not
incompatible with Thai astrology; it is mentioned at least once in the traditional astrological record. 45 Nonetheless, the most important implication of
Damrong's recollection is that there was subtle contention between
Mongkut and his court astrologers. Probably their forecast of the eclipse was
greatly different owing to the fact that while Mongkut preferred the Saram
and Western methods, most court astrologers consulted the other text.46 The
result of calculation by the latter was an eclipse but definitely not a total one
-and, besides, there was no such thing as a belt on earth. It is not hard to
imagine his isolation and the pressure created upon him as he took the risk of
putting his royal credibility into the confrontation. It was much more than
an intellectual exercise, and his opponents were not just astrological persons
but a kind of establishment. Since he had forecast the eclipse, he was obsessed
by the calculation in every precise detail to prove his knowledge and the
king's credibility.
Confident in his wisdom, Mongkut organized an observation of this full

46

Chapter Two

eclipse and resolved to lead it himself, despite his age (sixty-four) and the
hardship of traveling and residing in the jungle. For the sake of precision and
in order to confirm his ability, moreover, he selected Wako, a wilderness in
the middle of a disease-ridden rainforest, as the chosen place for observation
47
because it was exactly the position pinpointed by the calculation. Furthermore, he invited the high-ranking officials of European powers in the region
to join the observation at Wako. The British and French accepted the invitation and brought with them a large entourage with many instruments for
observation and scientific experiments. The Siamese party was large as well,
and had many superfluous facilities for surviving the jungle and for entertaining the king and his royal guests. They prepared no instruments, for example, but brought ice from Bangkok. The Wako meeting became an international astronomical observation, perhaps the only one on such a majestic scale
ever organized in this region. At its heart, symbolically, was the rendezvous
of indigenous astrology and Western astronomy, as well as everything in the
spectrum in between.
The fateful day, 18 August 1868, was an overcast day at Wako. Everyone
was ready for the full eclipse, especially the Europeans who had already set
their instruments. Unfortunately, the sun was hardly seen either by naked
eye or by instruments. The weather almost upset the international event. But
suddenly, just as the eclipse began, the sky cleared and the full eclipse was
witnessed by everyone present. The full eclipse occurred in accord with
Mongkut's forecast in every detail. Unlike his European guests, he had not
prepared any scientific experiment: the full eclipse itself was a successful
experiment. It was a magnificent recognition of his most important triumph.
His victory was not a total defeat for indigenous knowledge, however. His
accomplishment owed as much to Western geographical and astronomical
knowledge as to his own beloved expertise in native astrology. Only the new
idea of celestial bodies and how to calculate them was proved to be superior.
Even for Mongkut himself, the suddenly clearing sky was a miracle-a gift of
deities who should therefore be partly credited for the success. Once the full
eclipse began to recede, while the Europeans were still busy with their scientific experiments, Mongkut began making religious offerings in gratitude to
those deities. 48
When he returned to Bangkok, Mongkut found that the court astrologers, including the chief, Phra Horathibodi, and many high-ranking nobles
who stayed in Bangkok, could not give proper answers to his questions about
the eclipse as seen in Bangkok. He punished them severely, sending them to
labor at the royal park for one day and sentencing them to prison for eight
days.49 Then he issued a letter about the full eclipse, attacking those who did

The Coming ofa New Geography

47

not believe him. He condemned those who earned more money than the cost
of offerings made to the deities but had not been interested in his calculation
of the eclipse. He condemned them for their coarse, plebeian minds and stupid statements because of their negligence of his detailed prediction and their
inattention to measurement and calculation by modern instruments. They
left the servants responsible for timekeeping; they were careless toward detail
and accepted the crude forecast of the court astrologers. Moreover, the way
they watched the eclipse was vulgar-using hands to shade their bare eyesand the clock they used was terribly unreliable: "Only temple people or old
monks still used [that kind of clock]." He then scolded the astrologers who
had been in the monkhood for many years for boasting of themselves while
ignoring knowledge: "From now on, astrologers must stop their coarse, vul~ar, pleb~ian behavior like that of temple people or ex-monks." Everyone
mvolved m the event was ordered to make his own handwritten copy of this
letter. 50
To achieve such an accomplishment, unfortunately, Mongkut had worked
so hard that his health deteriorated. The risk of choosing Wako as the observation site had produced success, but Mongkut and his son, Chulalongkorn,
contracted malaria on the expedition. Chulalongkorn was in serious condition for a considerable period, but he survived. Mongkut did not. Mongkut
won the struggle against the orthodox court astrologers and indigenous cosmology. But it was a tragic victory. He sacrificed himself for his cause.

Space in a New Mode: Modern Geography
Since we conceive the world via the mediation of a certain conception, different conceptions, in turn, affect our knowledge of the earth and related geographical practices. How different would the world be if a late-nineteenthcentury Thai conceived it with modern geography? And how does this
spatial discourse work in relating human beings to space? To answer the
questions, we must examine modern geography as it was brought into that
historical setting.
Thiphakorawong was unsuccessful in his efforts to have his book, Kitchanukit, read among schoolchildren. Nonetheless, modern geography was
establis~ed in Siam very rapidly. Only eight years after Thiphakorawong's
book, SIX years after Mongkut's fatal triumph, the first geography book in
Thai was published in 1874. Based on an English text, Phumanithet was written by J. W. Van Dyke, an American missionary living in Siam between
1869 and 1886, with a dedication to King Chulalongkorn and best wishes for
the future of Siam. 5 1 It was a book of "the world atlas" (phaenthilok) in Thai.

48

Chapter Two

A white elephant stood in the middle of the front page above the publishing
year given in Thai calendrical reckoning.
Phumanithet was used in only a limited number of schools, mainly in those
run by the American missionaries. The book never received official recognition as a textbook. During the early years of the new educational system in
Siam in the 1880s, geography was not a subject for all students except in the
upper secondary levels of the English program offered in certain schools; the
traditional doctrines of cosmology were still studied in most Thai schools. In
1887, following Chulalongkorn's criticism that the books then in use were
worthless since they were full of stories of kings and battles (chakchak
wongwong), a new educational minister, Prince Damrong, initiated a reform
of curriculum and all textbooks for Thai schools. In 1892 the new curriculum
commenced; modern geography was now a subject at every level of the secondary schools. 52 A new generation of geography texts was urgently needed.
The new curriculum of 1892 stated that geography meant the study of the
earth, solar system, planets, and natural phenomena. It also concerned the
practice of drawing up plans for a house, a village, or a town and the use of
maps. 53 Subsequent improvements of the curriculum in 1895 and 1898
required geography in almost every grade and more detailed and sophisticated
treatments at the higher levels, such as the study of other countries and elementary techniques of mapmaking. Among the textbooks that proliferated
under these initiatives was W. G. Johnson's Phumisat sayam (Geography of
Siam), which later became a model for many other texts. 54
These textbooks may tell us how modern geography was disseminated and
conceived in those days. They are refined conceptual tools to equip students
with new ideas of space, the new geography. These early texts were rather
simple. They conveyed a very elementary knowledge of modern geography.
When more sophisticated books were written, the earlier books were relegated to use by primary school children, if not discontinued altogether; one
text became a reader for the study of Thai language, not of geography. Like
the elementary grammar of a language, such a text is always simple, and
necessarily so.
These textbooks indicate that by the early twentieth century the traditional belief in a flat earth was already marginalized. None of these books
troubled to argue against such an idea. Nor was it mentioned. The only
exception was the 1902 textbook by Phraya Thepphasatsathit which mentioned the idea that the earth was supported by the Anon Fish, a mythical
creature. But here Thepphasatsathit made up a story of a rather dull boy talking with a local uneducated man. 55 In the same book, by contrast, when the
teacher asked his pupils about the shape of the earth, all the children raised

The Coming ofa New Geography

49

their hands, one answering, "like an orange." 56 For the author of this textbook, knowledge of the spherical earth was so common that every child
should be able to answer such a simple question, although one of them might
hesitate because of the opinions of an uneducated older man.
Certainly the world of the Traiphum cosmography had no place in these
geographical texts. The earth of modern geography is a planet in the solar
system and orbits around the sun. Its surface consists of a number of great
continents and oceans. Above all, according to these texts, this earth is full of
prathet, that is, countries or nations. The word prathet in the old usage simply
meant a place or an area (district, region, town, even an area of the forest). It
signified a piece of the earth's surface without any specific qualification of
size, population, or power. Traces of this old meaning still appeared in most
of the dictionaries of the Thai language compiled in the late nineteenth or
early twentieth century. 57 But by that time, the meaning of prathet as a nation
was also appearing in some of them. 58 The new specific definition of prathet
came from the new geographical conception of the earth, as explained in Van
Dyke's Phumanithet and Johnson's book.
According to Van Dyke, the earth's surface is divided into continents and
oceans. A continent is composed of "governed (or occupied) territories"
divided by boundaries and called kingdoms, empires, or republics. Each of
these territories is a prathet. In a prathet there must be a capital and the
supreme ruler, called a king, an emperor, or a president, and other parts governed by chaomuang (governors or provincial rulers) under the power of the
capital. 59 With the exception of the first two chapters, the book devotes one
chapter to each continent. 6° For each continent, selected nations (prathet) are
described, starting with Prathetthai. The maps of each continent as well as
Siam are shown at the beginning of the relevant chapters; notes on the scale
and symbols used in the maps are provided on the last page of the book.
The use of the term "Prathetthai" throughout this book is worth noting
since the Siamese called their country "Muang Thai," the country of the
Thai, and the outside world called it "Siam" until the new name, "Thailand" in English and "Prathetthai" in Thai, was adopted in 1941. Likewise,
other countries are identified in this book by putting their names after the
word prathet. It appears that the term prathet was chosen to replace the term
muang. Muang refers broadly to a community, a town, a city, even a country
-that is, an occupied area under the exercise of a governing power but without specification of size, degree or kind of power, or administrative structure.
While the meaning of muang has been flexible, the new knowledge took over
a very broad unspecified term, prathet, ascribing to it a very specific meaning
in the grammar of modern geography: a nation.

50

Chapter Two

The new specific meaning of the word prathet was also hinted at by Johnson. In the earlier editions of his book, the names he uses for Siam are varied:
Prathetsayam or Sayamprathet in the early pages, Krungsayam in the later
pages. 61 The word for England is Krung-angkrit. The term krung, originally
meaning a great city, had been used by Mongkut and his contemporaries to
mean a kingdom, a usage that lasted for some time. But from the 1914 edition onward, most of the instances of krung in the earlier editions were
replaced by the term prathet, with only a few exceptions in the final pages.
Johnson gave the definition of a prathet in the "introduction to geography" as parts of the earth's surface inhabited by different nationalities. The
62
part of Asia where Thai people lived, for instance, was called Sayamprathet.
As a book of geography of Siam, here he defines the location by two kinds of
statements. First, Siam is on the peninsula in the southeastern part of Asia;
second, he lists the names of nations surrounding Siam. 63
It appears that the most significant feature of modern geography as introduced to the children of Siam is a spherical earth filled with nations on its surface. Siam is one among them; it is certainly situated somewhere on earth. A
prathet is a territory on the earth's surface which is empirically perceivable. It
can be identified by at least two methods: first, by its definite place on earth
in reference to the larger space of which it is part; second, by referring to the
"boundary relation" to the governed space surrounding it. In the first
method, sometimes the referential space is not a mere continent but the
whole earth in terms of the coordinate specification preferred by Mongkut.
Likewise, throughout the book Phumanithet Van Dyke could tell his readers
about the existence of each nation only by referring to the part of the continent where such a nation stood and then by mentioning its neighboring territories. The empiricity of a nation such as Siam on the earth's surface was so
real that one could say that its shape was like an old axe of the palace guard or
a coconut-shell dipper. Modern geography has promised its believers the existence of Siam and all nations as if they were natural.
But if no one had ever seen a nation-filled earth with one's own eyes, and if
the whole region of neighbors was never simultaneously observable, how
could one understand these two methods? What made these statements sensible, apart from general knowledge of the spherical earth? Both methods have
one thing in common. They require the knowledge of a map of the earth, or
of a continent, or at least a specific part of the earth. In fact, Van Dyke in his
Phumanithet has to provide his readers with maps of the round earth and a
particular continent for each chapter. A brief explanation of what a map is
and the basic reading technique is also given in the early pages of the book.
He explicitly recommends that his readers use an atlas in reading his book for

a better view of a nation's features. In the first edition of Johnson's book,
there were two maps attached: the map of Asia (with sketchy details) and
the "map of Siam's boundaries" with all the surrounding countries being
mentioned. 64
We may wonder how one could understand where Siam was and what it
looked like without having seen these maps and without having even an elementary knowledge of reading them. Without the general knowledge of a
map, neither kind of statement is intelligible. It may be further doubted
whether other kinds of communication in this mode of spatial perception
could be possible without any knowledge of a map. But how can a map make
statements intelligible in this kind of geography? To put it more simply, how
does a map work? What is a map?

Space Encoded: The Modern Map
Another geography text of that first generation may help us answer the questions posed above. Thepphasatsathit's two volumes of Geography first
appeared in 1902 and 1904 respectively. 65 Both of them may have been
among the longest-serving texts for schoolchildren and the most frequently
reprinted in the history of school curricula in Siam. 66 In the second volume,
the first ten chapters are lessons on elementary knowledge about mappingfrom how to determine the cardinal points to methods for reading and drawing a map. In this process, a student would learn step by step about a plan, a
scale, a map, the relation between a plan and a map, and the relationship
between them and the reality they represent.
According to the lessons, a plan is an "outline," in the very strict sense of
the word, of a thing as if it were seen from above (chaps. 2-3). A plan is different from a picture because the latter can tell the viewer what a thing is as if
it had been witnessed, whereas a plan can only indicate the configuration of
the thing and its size or distances from other things in the same plan (chap.
4). A scale is a method to enlarge or reduce the size of a plan in proportion to
the thing. These are all prerequisites for lessons on mapping and the map of
Siam in chaps. 8-10. Since the original is written in the form of conversations
between Uncle and two boys, I offer the following abridged version:
Uncle asks, "What is a map?"
"It's a picture," a boy quickly replies.
"No," Uncle responds loudly, "a map is not a picture. If it were a picture,
we must see a lot of houses, trees, and people in it. But here we can't."
"A map is a plan, they're the same." He goes on explaining, "A map is a

Chapter Two

52

plan of the earth's surface, be it of lands or waters. The map which shows the
whole earth's surface is a plan of it."
Then Uncle points at the map of Siam and says, "This is the part of the eart~
where we live." He also explains that the colors on the map are not the earth s
colors; they would see Siam very green if they could fly above it. They then
look at the map of the Chao Phraya River and another one of Bangkok on
which they enjoy pointing at the positions of important places.
The boys enjoy learning about the map very much. They also lear~ that a
scale is always used in drawing a map, as well as many symbols whtch they
have to rememberY
This simple lesson is striking because it tells comprehensively, though not in
detail, how a map mediates between human thinking and space.
Since human beings experience the world and, apart from intuition or feelings, communicate to each other through signs in the complex ~lay of i~nu­
merable sign systems in everyday life, a map is just another ~md of s~gn.
According to theories of cartographic communication, a map 1s a medmm
between spatial reality and human, of both cartograp~er and us~r, to help
human beings perceive such space without the need of duect expenence. The
relationships between space, maps, and human perception-th~ fundamental
trio of cartographic communication-are very complex. The d1agram below
constitutes a very basic and simplified explanation according to these
theories. 68

The cartographer observes or surveys the geographical terrain (A) with
specific objectives for each kind of map. Then, by cartographic methods, he
or she conceptualizes it (B), transforms the data into a mapping form (C), and
the map is produced. The information transmitted by the map is perceived
(D) and translated by the user's knowledge of mapping. The complexity,
however, lies in each step of the diagram. The production of a map could be
affected by many factors that would result in different outcomes-such as the
cartographer's view, perception, particular objectives for each map, or different usage of symbols. All transformations from object to signs and from signs
to the reader's conception involve an interpretive process. 69 Thepphasatsathit's lesson implies many of these theoretical steps without purporting to
be a theoretical text. From all these theories and premises we can enhance our
argument about the specific nature of a map and its mechanisms of representation.
First, like a picture, a map claims to be a representation of spatial reality in
the form of two-dimensional graphics. As a kind of plan, it differs from a picture in its form of representing. According to Uncle, a picture records the
content of the spatial object as if the viewer were witnessing it. Since the
thing is viewed from just one point of view, its shape, its configuration seen
in a picture, cannot correspond to the actual shape, but the viewer can recognize it from the content. A plan, on the contrary, documents the shape, the
structural form, of a spatial object. For Uncle, a map is a kind of plan, viewing an object from above and preserving its form and structural relations of
the contents only. That is to say, a map is the structural configuration of
spatial objects.
Second, no matter how much a map may resemble the space it represents,
it can do so only by transforming the complex three-dimensional material
space into the mapping format. This transformation process requires at least
three kinds of procedures. First, the method of generalization means the
reduction, selection, combination, distortion, approximation, or exaggeration of the very details of space to make them data for each particular map.
Second, the method of scaling means an enlargement or reduction of real
measurements by certain ratios. Third, the symbolization means the use of
symbols or other devices to represent certain things. 70 Thanks to geometry,
the data are transformed by geometric calculation and represented mostly by
geometric symbols. The result is an interpretive abstraction of the material
space.
Third, despite this interpretive abstraction, a map claims to have a mimetic
relationship with reality. A map is able to operate as long as one postulates
that a map is the non-interfering medium between spatial reality and human

,..
54

Chapter Two

perception-that reality is the source and the referent of the relationship.
One of the important topics of cartographic communication is the degree of
arbitrariness and mimesis in the devices used in a map, that is, the study of
how particular marks, symbols, sizes, colors, or even positions of these
devices can represent reality in different degrees of arbitrariness and mimesis.'l Some even argue that a map has intrinsic connections with the external
world of perceived reality whereas a diagram is merely an arbitrary device
which has no such connection. 72 Without this assumption of an intrinsic connection with the external world, Uncle and the two boys could not have fun
identifying public buildings and city sights on the map of Bangkok. As we
shall see, however, this postulate is questionable.
Fourth, nonetheless, a map is communicable among producers and users,
and conceivable in its relation to object, because in both the transformation
process by cartographers and the reading process by users, the whole mechanism of a map-structure, symbols, scale, and so forth-is based on a common cartographic language. A map survives by conventions. Uncle must
teach the boys the conventions. Schoolchildren in every society participating
in this same global civilization of modern geography must learn the conventions. They must be put through this socializing process to keep the rules and
conventions conventional. A map, a combination of symbols in the form of
two-dimensional graphics, is given life by the rules and conventions provided
only by the study of modern geography and the elementary techniques of
mapping. Only by this global practice is the space represented by a map (if
properly read) guaranteed to be unambiguous, though a few discrepancies are
possible.
Finally, a map not only represents or abstracts spatial objects. Perhaps the
most fascinating novelty of this technology is its predictive capacity. In fact,
one of the most fundamental methods of mapmaking is mathematical projection. The globe is so huge; the human is so small; yet curiosity extends
beyond the globe. Once the earth's surface was assumed as the ultimate reference of modern maps in the sixteenth century, the latitude-longitude grid for
the entire planet was developed to establish a general matrix for measurement. Since then, the world has fascinated generations of humans by its
unknown places yet to be discovered in order to fill in the blank squares
established by the mathematical projection. A modern map can predict that
something is certainly "there" at particular coordinates; the facts and knowledge will be "discovered" later by true believers of the modern map. Therefore, how could a nation resist being found if a nineteenth-century map had
predicted it?
In short, a map is a code for a presumed spatial object in modern geogra-

The Coming ofa New Geography

55

phy. As a sign, a map appropriates a spatial object by its own method of
abstraction into a new sign system. A map encodes a space which, in turn,
can be decoded to disclose knowledge of the supposed real space. It is a product of scientific method as well as of the social institutions of our modern
time.
The kind of map considered here is totally different from the maps of premodern geography. The differences are due not only to techniques but also to
different kinds of knowledge and the conceptions behind them. In the indigenous conception, for example, space is usually identified with certain aspects
of the sacred or the religious. It is an intrinsic quality of space. Or to put it in
another way: the religious subordinates the materiality of space, making the
latter dependent on, or an expression of, religious value. By contrast, modern
geography is a discipline which confines itself to the study of the material
~pace _on_ earth. Space on a modern map, at least space which human beings
mhabtt, ts concrete and profane. Thus the premodern maps had no interest in
the accuracy of measurements and required no scientific, empirical methods.
~ map merely illustrated the fact or truth that had been known already,
etther cosmography, moral teaching, or a traveling route. A modern map, on
the contrary, dismisses the imaginary and sacred approaches to the profane
world. It constitutes the new way of perceiving space and provides new
methods of imagining space which prevent the "unreal" imagination and
allow only legitimate space to survive after the decoding process.
In a premodern map, there was no inference that a spatial unit depicted
was part of a spatial wholeness. There was no indication of the position of
that unit on the earth's surface. But to draw a map of a nation always implies
~global wholeness of which the spatial unit on the map is merely a part. The
tmportance of the global plane of reference in its materiality adds one more
dis~inction: perhaps the most important one. A premodern map was merely
an tllustratton of another narration, be it a religious story or the description
of a travel route. Some may not refer to any spatial reality at all. This kind of
map was not indispensable. On the contrary, since the spatial reality a modern map of a nation purports to represent is never directly experienced in its
totality-indeed, it is impossible to do so-a modern map is an indispensable
mediator in perceiving and conceptualizing such macrospace in its totality, a
function none of the premodern maps ever performed.
As a part of the globe, moreover, the map of a nation must be viewed
against the earth's surface and the methods to indicate this are indispensable
as well. All methods imply that each part of the globe, a nation, and its maps
can be connected to form the whole globe through the patchwork of boundary lines. Indeed, boundary lines are so important for a map of a nation that

Chapter Two

56

the latter cannot exist without the former. A nation can be imagined without
a word or other symbol or color on a map, but this is impossible if boundary
lines, the symbol which forms the entity of a map of a nation, are exclude~.
Boundary lines are indispensable for a map of a nation to exist-or, to put It
in another way, a map of a nation presupposes the existence of boundary
lines. Logically this inevitably means that boundary lines must exist before. a
map, since a medium simply records and refers to an existing reality. ~ut ~n
this case the reality was a reversal of that logic. It is the concept of a nat10n m
the modern geographical sense that requires the necessity of having boundary
lines clearly demarcated. A map may not just function as a medium; it could
well be the creator of the supposed reality.
A country represented by this code was entering a new kind of eart~ space
which had another set of rules and conventions, another mode of relat10ns. If
a map is more than a recording or reflecting medium, the transform~tion m~y
be more complex than anyone might expect. To put this problem mto a historical framework, the imaginability of a nation in terms of a map involves a
number of changes-both in concept and in the human practices concerning
the domain and limits of a country. The most important precondition is the
conception and practices of boundary lines which distinguish one unit of sovereign space from another. The boundary of a nation works in two. ways .at
the same time. On the one hand, it sets a clear-cut limit on a sovereign umt;
on the other hand, it imposes a sharp division between at least two units of
space. In other words, it is the edge of one unit as _well as a thing. in between.
Consequently, many conceptions and practices of mterstate relauo~s ~ust be
changed to conform with the new geography of a country. The mdigenous
concepts must be displaced.

Modality: Ambiguity and Displacement
A history of the geo-body of Siam is not a chronological description of
boundary demarcations and the events which led to the making of Siam's
map. Rather, the case of Mongkut and the relationship between astrology
and astronomy, all highlighted by the Wako event, is a vivid example of how
complex the displacement of geography was. It was a case in whic~ differe~t
kinds of geographic knowledge coexisted, collided, and were fmally displaced.
The Wako expedition highlighted the encounter of two sets of knowledge. Even its meaning to our time is ambiguous. Mongkut ":'as praised as
the Father of Thai Science and 18 August has now been officially declared
National Science Day. The word "Thai science" means modern scientific

The Coming ofa New Geography

57

knowledge in Thailand, not the indigenous Thai science, judging from the
reasons given for Mongkut's elevation, such as his expertise in astronomy, his
stand against superstition and astrologers, his interest in modern medical science and scientific innovations such as steamships and the printing press. 73
Not only are these terms unclear and subject to interpretation, but the reasons given do not quite account for what happened. Though it can be said
that the Wako event and 18 August constituted the triumph of (Western)
science, Mongkut's love of astrology and his belief in the assistance of the deities should not be discounted. Ironically, therefore, Mongkut has also been
regarded by Thai astrologers as the "Father of Thai Astrology," 74 meaning
the indigenous astrology. Likewise, one cannot ignore the facts that the cosmological reference of his calculation came from Western astronomy and that
Mongkut was hostile to traditional astrologers.
There is another appraisal of Mongkut and the Wako event which avoids
deciding one way or the other between Western astronomy and native astrology. One can argue that the aim of the Wako event was in fact political-psychological. It proved that Siam equaled the West in terms of knowledge, and
therefore the imperialists' claim that Siam was uncivilized and had to be colonized was unreasonable. 75 This idea assumes a patriotic unity of the court
against imperialist aggression. It is beyond doubt a nationalistic retrospection. The adversaries in Mongkut's struggle were in fact traditional Thai
astrologers, while the Europeans functioned as an international pressure
group implicitly supporting Mongkut in his cause.
Nonetheless, the true meaning may be ambiguous rather than subject to a
single interpretation. It would be a mistake to regard Mongkut's endeavor as
the indigenous maneuver against the Western worldview or vice versa. It was
an epistemological hybrid-regardless of whatever inconsistency, contradiction, or logical discomfort we may attribute to it. Each interpretation of the
event has tried to prescribe a certain meaning-hence value-to it in order to
claim Mongkut and his conviction as its predecessor. Rather, the ambiguity
of the whole event and Mongkut's epistemological hybrid was in itself a critical phase of the shift of knowledge.
One of Mongkut's contemporary biographers wrote in the concluding paragraph of a famous account of Mongkut's life that
[Mongkut] understood astrology well, both in Siamese and European scripts.
He could calculate the movements of the sun and all planets in great detail, predicting solar and lunar eclipses so precisely that no one could match him. He
also knew yiokrapfi [geography] very well, measuring the sun and stars accurately.... He was unremittingly faithful to the Three Gems ofBuddhism. 76

58

Chapter Two

Here was the first account of a Siamese king whose ability in a traditional
"science" like astrology and his True Faith were mentioned on either side of
a new ambitious discipline about the sun, stars, and certainly the earth
though it was not mentioned, a discipline which was comprehensively called
geography in the Thai tongue. The place of yiokrapfl in this paragraph was by
no means accidental.
Astrology was a privileged science in a society which believed that human
affairs are influenced or predetermined by celestial bodies. In astrology, the
calculation of positions and movements of celestial bodies and the art of interpreting their influence are the two fundamental tasks. Astrologers became
powerful "scientists" at every level of such a society, from the court to the
village community, because they held the expertise to calculate celestial causes
and predict the effects. The art of prediction may be, in our view, not objective or even superstitious, yet it is based on previous interpretations and the
cumulative record of those phenomena believed to be influenced by celestial
entities in certain positions. Furthermore, astrological calculation has mathematical rules in the framework of a cosmology developed through many generations. Perhaps the knowledge about celestial movements of astrology was
no less mathematically objective than that of astronomy.
Astrology, accordingly, relies on the precision of its calculations, just as
many modern sciences rely on mathematics. The more precise the calculation,
the more accurate and reliable the astrological explanation. It appears that for
the sake of precision of calculation, Western knowledge of celestial movements and the earth, as well as the scientific spirit of empirical observation,
were, to some people like Mongkut and his followers, as attractive as many
other sciences of worldly matters. These people replaced the indigenous
knowledge with the new yiokrapfl. But in doing so, they did not aim at eradicating indigenous astrology. Rather, they were eager to obtain the most upto-date knowledge to improve the calculations. Yiokrapfl, which in fact
included astronomy as well, performed a task of indigenous astrology with
more accuracy and hence more reliability. The two fundamentally incompatible kinds of knowledge were matched up and found to be functionally compatible. They could be placed side by side within the same paragraph of
Mongkut's "life-text," -biography.
It should be noted here that in the Thai astrological treatises of later times,
the solar system and the astronomical universe served 'as the framework of
celestial movements and calculation without disturbing the systematic methods of prediction. Up-to-date astronomical discoveries such as knowledge
about the three furthest planets in the solar system are now regarded as a part
of astrological knowledge and even help astrologers to improve or expand

The Coming ofa New Geography

59

their method of horoscopic calculations. A renowned astrologer claims that
Mongkut was his predecessor in this unorthodox approach. 11
As a consequence of this conceptual and functional compatibility, the
at~e~pt to grasp modern geography was done only by assimilating it through
extstmg concepts-and above all through the existing terminology-just as a
new language is always learned through translation into one's mother
tongue. Take physical geography as an example. The classification of physical
geography in the first chapter of Van Dyke's book, in Johnson's "Geography
of Siam," and in the first volume ofThepphasatsathit's book was very similar
to t~e taxonomy of the Traiphum cosmology. This indigenous taxonomy
provtded the means by which modern geography could be understood.
Despite different conceptual systems, the indigenous taxonomy also became
the vocabulary of modern geography.
The word phum, generally meaning land or world, becomes the keyword
for "geography" in Thai-phumisat. Moreover, the title of Van Dyke's book,
Phumanithet, was in fact the title of a chapter in the classic cosmological doctrine, Chakkawanthipani, though in that case it was a chapter about the deities
and the underworlds. Later, this word also appeared in documents with the
same meaning as geography.78 The Thai terms for continent, oceans, and
other geographical units, including prathet, were also drawn from this storehouse of knowledge that paralleled the new nomenclature. For this reason, it
is n~t surprising that most of the Thai terminology for modern geography,
particularly about the cosmos and macrospace, is taken from the Traiphum
taxonomy.
Not only did the two kinds of knowledge have similar subject matters,
therefore, but they also shared the same terminology in comparable classifications. Thus, not only did they coexist, but they overlapped by sharing the
same terminological domain. To put it in another way: the terminologywords-became the interface of two knowledges. Conversely, these terms in
mutual usage had double meanings and different denotations according to the
respective conceptual systems. The terminology, and perhaps the whole classificatory system, became a system of double signifiers. Hence the knowledge
of space and its terminology became ambiguous. As a consequence, the new
geography faced a twofold task: a defensive one, to unravel any confusion
and to differentiate itself from the other; and an offensive one, to take advantage of the compatibility and the ambiguity of geographical discourse.
Consider the first task. Because the conceptual systems behind the same
terminology and behind the comparable classification were not the same, a
word could transmit different messages depending on the code in operation.
The defensive or unraveling task meant that there had to be a certain signal to

60

Chapter Two

inform the audience of a new conceptual reference. The use of a modern map
was an example of this signaling code, since it was a property exclusive to the
new geography. For other signaling codes, Thiphakorawong's Kitchanukit is
a splendid illustration of how both languages of space could play in the same
field under different rules. The author was obviously conscious of the growing ambiguity of geographical knowledge as a whole, yet he under~tood the
distinctions between the different languages. One of the most senous confrontations between the contending geographical languages lay, as we have
seen, in the fundamental question of the concept of the earth. This issue came
to demarcate the two sides. It seems that by beginning with statements of
what the earth looked like, both Van Dyke and Johnson did more than just
convey the correct idea to their readers. Indeed, they put up a sign at the
entrance to their books. The statements about the spherical earth functioned
as the signaling code-the "password" to communicate that the story inside
belonged to that particular language. Later, among the books of that generation it became a tradition to begin a geographical book with introductory
stat:ments about the earth, no matter what kind of geography they described
-physical or political, of Siam or of other parts of the world. Even atlases of
later times always started with maps of a round earth, similar to Johnson's
introductory statements. It became a convention with its original function no
longer performed; in other words, a tradition, not an active code.
.
.
The second task was more important. To say that the geographical discourse became ambiguous means the indigenous spatial discourse was no
longer the only language which supplied the grammar, or monopolized the
codes, for perceiving space. In addition to the powerful support from royal
authority and the intellectual elite, modern geography now imposed itself as
a contender-a contesting language which could share certain properties with
the previous one-and asserted its authority over the field of signification.
In this condition of ambiguity, the existing knowledge of space was destabilized, while the alternative became a threat to change. Modern geography
never passively coexisted; nor did it simply rely on political support, the nonepistemological force, to propose itself as an alternative. Even though translation into the indigenous terminology was done by human beings for the purpose of human apprehension, it was beyond human intentio~ once ~he
compatibility was established. Modern geography had the potential_ to ~nve
itself to usurp those properties of the indigenous knowledge, assertmg itself
as a new channel of message transmission. It waited for human intervention
only to settle ambiguity in one way or another. In short, modern geography
took advantage of the overlapping domains to make the indigenous language

The Coming ofa New Geography

61

unstable, or ambiguous, and then proposed itself as a new way of signifying
those terms.
The displacement of knowledge was a process which by no means implied
a gradual, smooth, continuous adjustment. It was a process in which critical
moments erupted, determining the ambiguity in a particular way. It was
more or less violent. The Wako event was one such critical moment. The
ambiguity of retrospective evaluation of the Wako event was due to the
ambiguous nature of Mongkut and his ideological tendency in whom and in
which modern geography resided alongside the indigenous conceptions.
Mongkut's attacks on astrologers and Thiphakorawong's book were also
among such moments which brought the contending geographical ideas to
disruptive confrontation.
To argue that the establishment of scientific ideas in Siam enjoyed a
smooth-as-silk continuity is to imply there was no significant friction, let
alone rupture, between conceptions and practices of the competing knowledge. That, however, was not the case. What did Mongkut's life mean if not
a tragic victory in an epistemological battle? The explanation advanced here
can serve as a model for other aspects of the displacement of geographical
knowledge as well. They too resulted from various confrontations, ambiguities, and disruptive moments at different times, places, and paces. Our
focus here is on the conceptions and practices of boundaries and territorial
sovereignty. As we shall see, one of the most disruptive moments in the displacement of geographical knowledge is a well-known episode in Thai history. But it has traditionally been understood in another way: as an agonizing event for Thai of all strata because it ended with the so-called loss of
territories to the European powers in the latter half of the nineteenth century.

Chapter Three

Boundary

SIAM AND BuRMA had been arch-rivals since the sixteenth century. As both
sides launched periodic attacks against each other, the towns between the
two kingdoms, particularly those along the southern coast of Burma, which
until then was known as the Mon region, became crucial for both sides. In
fact the whole area between the two kingdoms consisted of vast rainforests
and huge ranges of mountains from north to south along the entire frontier.
Yet both sides regarded the Mon towns as rich sources of food and manpower
for fighting, two of the most important factors in premodern warfare. From
time to time, people and towns came under the control of one side to cultivate food for the troops while they were at the same time the targets of
destruction from the other to prevent them from supplying the enemy.

Western Boundary on the Western Frontier
Our drama begins in the first half of the nineteenth century when the British
waged the first war against Burma, then the kingdom of Ava, in 1824-1826.
In 1825, the British envoy to the court of Siam, Captain Henry Burney, was
assigned by the East India Company to negotiate with Siam on several issues,
especially the affairs of the Malay states and the trade agreement between
them. Despite what some historians have said about the Anglo-Ava war having frightened the Siamese court, the attitude of the court toward the British
was described by Burney as cordial. It seems that the court cautiously welcomed any power which fought against the Burmese. Throughout his
reports, Burney tells us that the Siamese court followed the course of the war
intently and was eager to hear any information or rumors about the fighting.
Having a common enemy, Siam and the British almost reached agreement on
sending two regiments of Siamese troops to support the British. The agree-

62

ne:er came about, however, because of misunderstandings on both
sides owmg to different styles of warfare and because the war ended a few
months later.
During the time Burney was in Bangkok in late 1825 and early 1826 th
British
the southern part of Burma, making it the
Tenassenm Provmce. Then the western frontier of Siam became a question.t
Burney ~equested the court to depute a high-ranking official to negotiate the
boundanes between their newly acquired territory and Siam. The Phrakhlang, who held a position equivalent to the minister of foreign affairs and
tra~e, deflec~ed the request by saying that both Tavoy and Mergui, two
maJor ports m southern Burma, were in fact Siamese boundaries and Siam
had been preparing to recover them from the Burmese. Now that they had
fallen i~to British hands, however, for the sake of friendship between the two
countnes, w~ose common enemy was still in the north (Ava), Siam would no
longer lay claim to them. "With more appearance of frankness and sincerity
~han · · · e~pected," Burney reported, the Phrakhlang also blessed the BritIsh o~cupatwn and "hoped a flourishing trade would be soon brought by the
Enghsh to Bangkok through that channel."
As it appears, the answer did not quite respond to the question. So Burney
repeated :he reques~ an~ sug.~ested that the Phrakhlang himself should go to
the frontiers. At this pomt, the Minister rolled his large body round, stared
at me, and.~:emed as muc~ startle~ as if I had proposed to him to take a trip
to Europe. Bur~ey explamed this reaction by saying that the Siamese king
(t~en Rama. I!I) did not trust anybody from his court to conclude agreements
With the Bntish; therefore, the person deputed would not have authority and
c~uld ~ot make any decision. D. G. E. Hall remarks that Burney's suggestiO·n· might have frightened the Phrakhlang because any negotiation with the
~ntlsh, apart from the one conducted in Bangkok, would jeopardize the
m_dependence of Siam. 3 Such was probably not the case. The Phrakhlang was
fnghtened, but the question of independence was not the likely issue. It is
mo~e probable that under the territorial division of power of the Siamese
regime_ at that time the southwestern part of the kingdom was under the
authonty of the Kalahom, another high-ranking noble. Thus any negotiation
by the Phrakhlang_ over that domain meant a threat to the Kalahom's power.
The Phrakhlang did not want to put himself at risk. Perhaps taking a trip to
Europe would have been less frightening to him. In any case, the reply indicated that the boundary demarcation was not yet an issue for the court's concern.
On the following day the Phrakhlang carried a message from the Kalahom
to Burney: the boundary question was not urgent since, at the time, it was

not yet certain that the British would decisively defeat the Burmese and in
fact be able to secure those towns. 4 For the Siamese court the boundary question depended on the outcome of the war. Had Burma struck back, it is more
likely that the towns would have been sacked again rather than becoming the
settlement of a boundary demarcation. For the Phrakhlang, friendship was a
sufficient reason to put aside a question of such low priority as a claim to
these ports; for the Kalahom, a boundary would not be necessary. Neither
the Phrakhlang nor the Kalahom took the question as seriously as Burney did.
Despite the court's lack of interest, Burney repeatedly urged it to negotiate
the boundaries. At last his efforts produced results. Astonishingly, the reply
was simple and straightforward:
With respect to what is said about the boundaries, the Country of Mergui,
Tavoy, and Tenasserim, no boundaries could ever be established between the
Siamese and the Burmese. But the English desire to have these fixed. Let them
enquire from the old inhabitants residing on the frontiers of Mergui, Tavoy,
and Tenasserim, what they know respecting the contiguous territories, and let
what they point out be the boundaries between the English and Siamese possessions.5
If this reply was regarded as naive by later historians like Hall, it was considered absurd by Burney who realized that such a statement would be received
with astonishment by British authorities. 6 But for a Siamese official on the
negotiating team, nothing was strange in such a reply, since
the boundaries between the Siamese and Burmese consisted of a tract of Mountains and forest, which is several miles wide and which could not be said to
belong to either nation. Each had detachments on the look out to seize any person of the other party found straying within the tract.'

It is clear that a "boundary" as understood by the British on the one hand
and their Siamese counterparts on the other was a similar thing but not the
same. For the Siamese court, it was hard to imagine why the question of
boundary should be so important; it should have been a matter for the local
people, not those in Bangkok. As a result, in the draft of the treaty prepared
by the Siamese there was nothing about boundary settlement, though there
were many statements about the domains belonging to Siam and to the British, implying that for Siam the distinction was already clear without the British kind of boundary. 8 Eventually, however, Burney persuaded the court to
reach broad agreement about the boundary demarcation, and he put it in the
subsequent drafts and in the final 1826 treaty. Written in Siamese fashion,

Boundary

65

the unnecessarily long article merely noted that if either side doubted any
boundary, it should depute some officials and people from the frontier posts
to inquire and settle mutual boundaries in a friendly manner. 9 This meant
that the existing boundary was not at issue and nothing needed be done.
More than half a year in Bangkok was enough for Burney to learn that the
best compromise he could manage in this matter was to put something about
it in the treaty, even though it could be seen to be of minor utility for the
British. In doing so, he conceded that he was speaking of the matter in the
same language as the Siamese court.
Except for some minor incidents in 1829 in which local Siamese officers
launched occasional raids into British territory, 10 until 1840 no issue was
raised by either party. In 1840, when E. A. Blundell became the commissioner of Tenasserim Province, he raised the matter again because the unsettled boundaries were causing trouble. The problem was tin mining. The
southernmost frontier of Tenasserim Province was traversed by the Pakchan
River, 11 both sides of which were rich in tin and other minerals. When the
Siamese local chief extended his authority by levying a share of revenue of the
tin miners on both sides, the miners refused to be double taxed by the British
as well while some Chinese tin miners requested British protection.t2 Blundell regarded the Pakchan River as the boundary on the ground that the oldest inhabitant said it was the furthest place Burmese troops had ever reached
and made temporary camp. He then sent a letter to Bangkok saying that the
Siamese local chief had made incursions into British territory. The court
replied at the end of that year that no boundary had been fixed yet, implying
that Blundell's claim was unacceptable.tJ
British authorities in India warned Blundell to be cautious, realizing from
Burney's experience that for some unknown reason the Siamese court was
not happy with its request on this matter. Even as late as 1842 the Bengal
authorities were not convinced of any urgent necessity to formalize the
boundaries. 14 Yet Blundell persistently urged Siam to depute officials to the
river, though the local Siamese officials were uncooperative. Then in mid1842, surprisingly, Siam agreed to indicate the boundary, although it did not
agree to regard the Pakchan River as the boundary line. 15 The rainy season,
however, prevented both sides from proceeding through the jungle to decide
the matter.
Siam was urged again in 1844 to decide the problem, since a few minor
incidents had already occurred along the borders. This time the new commissioner, Major Broadfoot, asked for the settlement of boundaries from
Chiangmai down to the Pakchan River. 16 The court seemed annoyed but
replied clearly that

Chapter Three

66

Boundary

the reasons of the English and Siamese nations having an occasion to speak
about the boundaries are ... [that] ... Siamese and the English nations being
in the state of great friendship, and as Major Broadfoot ... being desirous of
continuing the existing friendship has written a letter regarding the settlem~nt
of the boundary in amicable terms, the authorities of ... golden royal City
[Bangkok] are also anxious to have the bou~dary d~i~ed .... Request that
Major Broadfoot will ... settle justly and fauly which IS to be the boundary.
17
The Chiefs of ... golden royal city are desirous to agree.

In other words, for the sake of friendship, what the British desired, so did
Siam provided it was fair.
In 'the letter cited above, dated 13 November 1844, the court showed its
dissatisfaction with the British claim over the right bank of the Pakchan
River. It argued that minor disputes along the border~ ~ccurred b~cause British subjects and the people of Kra, the township exerCismg authonty over the
Pakchan River lived too close to each other. This would "cause some bad
feelings beteen,[sic] the two great friendly nations," the letter_said. Th~ Siamese thus opposed the British proposal because the Pakchan RlVer was JUSt a
few hundred meters from Kra.
What kind of boundary did the court prefer? Here is a suggestion:
Should the boundary line [be] fixed along the Pakchan River, this wou~d ?e
exceedingly close to Kra. On the other hand, should it be fixed at t~e l~m~ts
within which the Siamese have been accustomed formerly to exercise JUriSdiction it would still be far from Mergui. There should be a just decision, so
that th~ inhabitants of the two countries may live at some distance from one
another. 18

Perhaps the British did not properly understand this definition_of ~boundar~,
for they continued to reassert their proposal. The commumcat10~ o~ thts
matter went on to cover the question of the boundary of Moulmem m the
north of Tenasserim. Now the tone of the letters from the court in August
1845 and August 1846 turned sour. Ironically, the more annoyed the Siamese
court became, the stronger its commitment to settle the matter. In the former letter the court put forward a long counterproposal defining the boundaries from Chiangmai down to Kra. Then the letter said:
Whatever place it is desirable to examine the Governor and under officers of
that province will point out the extent of the Siamese bound~ry there. Let
them speak uprightly and the matter can be decided .... Havmg come to a
decision let there be a written agreement concerning every part of the boundary
line, which shall be final. Thus there will be, in future, no trespassing on one
another. 19

In the letter of August 1846, the question of the boundary seemed to be
very annoying. It referred to an incident in which a local Siamese officer was
accused of another incursion into British territory, planting a flag and exercising his authority over people in that area. The British suspected the court's
complicity in this action and questioned the sincerity of the court. The Siamese court investigated the case and concluded that the boundary must be
settled urgently to prevent any further conflict. 2° Certainly the British were
happy with this outcome. Although disagreement over certain boundaries
like the one at the Pakchan River still remained, Siam was ready to recognize
the importance of the boundary and committed itself to observing the demarcation. That is, Siam conceded to speak of the matter in the way that the
British preferred.
The reason for the change of attitude-from an ignorant and innocently
uncooperative one in the early years to a somewhat displeased but actively
cooperative one-is still unclear. The British tried to analyze this welcome
change. They attributed it to the effect of a battle which was then taking
place for a Kayah (or Red Karen) town in the mountainous area on the border of Chiangmai and Ava. The British thought it was a battle between
Burma and Siam, hence an international dispute. They logically put the two
events-the changing policy of Siam and the battle-into a diplomatic-military rationale: Siam was concerned about the security of its tributaries in the
north, so it was naturally desirous of meeting the wishes of the British to
secure the southern and western parts of the country. The British themselves
were alarmed by the Burmese campaign, but they stayed neutral. Communications among the British authorities between late 1844 and early 1846 were
full of discussions, reports, and speculations about the effect of the war on the
strained relations between Ava and Bangkok, since the British thought that
the Burmese intended to test the Siamese frontiers. They also urgently
informed the Siamese court of their neutrality on the issue. 21
The British, however, exaggerated the issue according to their own rationale. Bangkok knew nothing about the Burmese attacks on the Kayah township until December 1845 when the battle was already over. Chiangmai
merely reported that the Burmese had attacked a Red Karen township and
failed. Even Chiangmai did not regard the battle as its affair because the
Kayah town, as the report said, "belongs to no one." 22 That was all there
was to it. So, unsurprisingly, in the reply from Bangkok regarding the British neutral stand, the court did not mention anything about the battle. 23
The change in attitude toward the boundary question was in fact one
among many changes taking place in the last decade of the reigning Siamese
king, Rama III (r. 1824-1851). The relationship between Siam and the West

Chapter Three

Boundary

69

68
had been very good until then, and from the account of Burney himself it is
unlikely that this amicability had, as historians have suggested, deteriorated
since the 1820s as a result of the Anglo-Ava warY Siam under Rama III was
remarkable for its record of diplomatic relations with the West, and the king
was described by a contemporary British diplomatic officer as having been
"fond of the English." 25 In the last decade of the reign, however, the court
turned against the West. Although this change has not yet been adequately
accounted for, several explanations have been given: the conflicts in trade
relations, the impact of British operations in Burma and the 1840 Opium
War in China, and the threat of an American merchant who was in conflict
26
with the court and demanded that the British naval force support him.
These incidents, plus the court's cool reception of many diplomatic missions
from Western countries, indicate that the honeymoon period was over.
It appears that for the sake of friendship in the early years of the reign,
Siam was not interested in the settlement of a boundary as the British had
repeatedly urged. Yet when relations turned sour and the Siamese were
annoyed by increasingly aggressive British authorities in the 1840s, they
became more committed to it. Again, there is a hint here that the conceptions and functions of boundaries held by both sides were not the same.

Clashes of Conceptions of Boundary
During 1834-1836 a British mission was sent to Chiangmai, the center of the
Lanna kingdom, in the north of Thailand today. One of the tasks was to prepare for a negotiation of the boundary between Tenasserim Province and
Lanna. The British saw the potential of the area's timber industry, but,
studying local records, they found evidence of Burma's rights over the eastern side of the Salween River. Therefore, they prepared to propose the Salween as their boundary. The authorities in India approved the action but
warned not to push too hard and risk relations with Siam since the mission
was conducted without the knowledge of Bangkok. Strikingly, not only was
Chiangmai ready to make a treaty without Bangkok's approval, but for the
sake of friendship the king of Chiangmai also happily gave away a portion of
27
territory as a present which the British did not request.
The boundary agreement was simply in writing, however, without onthe-spot marking; Chiangmai, like Bangkok, was not interested in that kind
of task. In 1847, the British therefore urged Chiangmai to mark out the
boundaries as agreed in 1834. It would be quite simple, Chiangmai replied.
Let the British do the job themselves.
Neither the agreement nor the gift was done with Bangkok's knowledge.
The British were a little worried about this, but nothing could prevent them

from proceeding with their opportunity. Within two years, they had survey~d every fork of the Salween River in order to identify the main stream
which would be regarded as the boundary. And with the assistance of the five
oldest Karen along the river, they finished the job of marking the modernstyle boundaries in 1849. 2s
Another case in wh.ich a considerable portion of territory was given away
as a present occurred m the southernmost provinces. Captain James Low of
Penang suggested in 1829 that a boundary should be marked between Wellesley Province, then leased by the British, and Kedah, a Malay state then under
the overlordship of Nakhonsithammarat of Siam (hereafter Nakhon). But the
ruler .of Nakhon became angry with the request, saying that the Wellesley
~uestwn was already clear in the treaty between Kedah and Penang. Accordmg to the. treaty, which was concluded in 1802 without Siam's knowledge,
ho~ev~r, It stated only how long and wide the portion called Wellesley was.
This might be clear enough for Nakhon's ruler, but not for the empirically
minded British. 29
The question of this boundary became an issue because there was a movement of loyalists to an ousted sultan (raja) of Kedah along the frontier of
Welle~ley and Kedah who aimed to restore him. Thus the ruling sultan often
sent his men across the border, which had not yet been clearly decided, to spy
on the movement. 30 Therefore in the following year, 1830, observing that
the treaty m:r~ly mentioned the width of Wellesley as 60 orlongs from the
coast, the Bntish suggested that boundaries should be defined. 31 They sug~ested, h~~ever, that they themselves undertake the defining: "His Lordship
~n Cou~c~lis of [the] opinion, that instead of alarming the Siamese or excitmg their Jealousy, it will be better that our own officers should measure out
the sixty orlongs and establish the line, leaving the Siamese when they choose
to take up the question to prove our measurement erroneous."32
This action could have been alarming. After the rebellion in Kedah in 1831
was suppressed with British assistance, however, the negotiation for a boundary to be marked by British officers was easier. They erected three brick pillars at three different places east of Wellesley and planned to connect them by
a road which would be regarded as the boundary. Because the boundary
would help the British to prevent the movement of the ex-raja's loyalists, the
ruler of Nakhon, with gratitude for British assistance, did more than the
Bri~ish had. exp:Cted. He wrote a letter to the British governor-general of
India, blessmg him and all the British, saying that:
I feel myself deeply indebted to my friend and now return him my sincere
thanks. Moreover the Rajah of Singapore (Mr. Ibbetson) asked me to settle the
land boundary betwixt the territory appertaining to Penang and that of the Sia-

Chapter Three

70

mese. I was exceedingly pleased at this request, and immediatel_r complied with
it. In an old agreement with the Company the measurement ~n land from the
sea was considered to be sixty orlongs. I have moreover now gtVen. much x:ore
than formerly in order to gratify the Rajah of Singapore and Captam Low.
Certainly, this was unexpected. The territory of Wellesle!,' Pr~vi~ce was no':
twice the size and richer!34 Like the king of Chiangmal s gift m 1834, this
agreement, and the bonus, were made without the knowledge of Bangko~.
Like the king of Siam, perhaps, the ruler of Nakhon was so fond of ~he Bntish that a year later he too asked for a regular contact with Bengal. Gifts were
given with a request just to see a steam vessel. 35

When the British wanted Siam to settle the boundaries fr~m ~h1an~m~1 t~
the Kra isthmus, they sent a letter in April1845. It was wntten man mtlmldating and didactic tone:
It is very desirable that there should be one uniform rule as regards the boun~­
ary line from north to south, and that by adhering to that rule all causes of misunderstanding should be forever removed.

· · d" ·
Within this boundary no Siamese authorities are to exerctse any J~~1s tctlOn,
d beyond this boundary no British authontles are to

[do so]. 36
The statements may not seem unusual to us, but for th~ .Siames~ this sort
of boundary was unfamiliar and to stipulate such condltl.ons m1ght have
seemed to them an offense. The tone of the court's answer m August of the
same year was no less didactic, therefore, and showed that the court was confident about its full knowledge of the areas. According to ~he cou~t, however, each area was under the jurisdiction of a local a~thonty. Bes1des, the
methods of boundary marking were anything but uniform fr~m north to
south. Remarkably, the boundary was identified not only by nvers, mo~n­
tains, and streams but also by teak forests, mountains upon mou~tams,
muddy ponds where there were three pagodas, Maprang trees, thre~ piles of
stones, the space between the White Elephant (?) and the No~g RIVer, and
so forth. 37 Definitely none was a line. The letter also co~plamed that the
valuable forests on the borders where people of Burma and S1am were use~ to
earning their living by collecting honey, sappan wood and teak, and.~untmg
elephants had been forbidden to them for twenty years since the Bntish had
occupied the area. Did this imply that for Siam a boundary should not prevent

'

.
people from their customary pursmts.

Boundary

71

Another case in 1846 also informs us about the differences in their concepts
of a boundary. Following the correspondence cited above, both Siam and
Tenasserim Province agreed to depute officials with full authority to decide
the boundary on the northeastern edge of Tenasserim. The appointment was
made for January 1846. The British officials arrived at the meeting place one
month late, however, while their Siamese counterparts, having waited a
whole lunar month, had returned just three days before. The British, who
had been instructed to negotiate with utmost amity, found that the Siamese
officials had advanced as far as a frontier town within claimed British territory and had laid down a pile of stones as the boundary mark to claim the
areas as Siam's. The British pulled the mark down.
The British in Tenasserim Province then protested in a letter that was
strong and satirical. They asked, for example, why Siam had not marked out
the boundary at the center of Moulmein. 38 The internal British communications were more serious. They were alarmed that Siam might have changed
its attitude toward the British. The diplomatic-military rationale came into
play again when they tried to sort out the cause of Siam's disturbing action.
They reasoned that the battle between Burma and Siam for the Red Karen
town had just been concluded, so Siam had no urgent reason to reach an
agreement with the British as they imagined had been the case earlier.
The Siamese court investigated the case and calmly replied in August 1846.
The court's version of the story was totally different. The Siamese officials
came back to Bangkok, reporting that they had met no British officials at the
rendezvous point. They made no report about any incursion into British territory or about marking a boundary. All of them confirmed that no order had
been issued to erect any boundary post or any marking. In fact, they came
back with nothing to discuss since they had not met the British team. But,
the court added,
the heap of stones together with a small wooden house for religious purposes
on the top of them ... was erected by the Talien people who stop at the
guardhouse of Utaitani merely as a mark to show ... that they might guard
as far as that. The English officer ordering the post to be taken down according
to the custom of [Bangkok], no notice can be taken of it. 39

It is likely that the Siamese team of local guards had in fact gone into British territory. But the mark erected was definitely not a boundary mark, and
the officials did not consider their movement as an incursion into the other's
territory. Hence no apology and no punishment. Whether or not the story
was true, the answer must have been considered a good reply to the British
charges. Hence the lack of evasion and embarrassment in telling the British
such a story. In fact, the court did ask a guard whether he intended to move

72

Chapter Three

into British territory and claim that domain-indicating no complicity of the
court but rather that the act was seen as a personal crime. The guard replied
that it was a three-day journey from his house, too far for him to go there.
The British were probably stunned by the answer, which must have come
as an anticlimax to the purported seriousness of the issue. Though they
might not have had a thorough understanding, it was enough for them to
realize that their interpretation of the incident was ludicrous-and any more
protests about the behavior of the guards would be equally absurd. In any
case, there was no further word from the British about this case. Nevertheless, the incident was one among many annoyances which made the court
resolve to settle a boundary demarcation.
Siam's willingness to decide the boundary on its side did not guarantee that
the demarcation would be decided within a few years, however. For anumber of technical, logistical, and other reasons, the task was carried out by the
court of Mongkut, which was more cooperative. Equipped with the knowledge to deal with the technicality of a boundary demarcation, and realizing
the complication which might cause political problems, Mongkut himself
worked out the details on various areas to be marked, including the question
of Pakchan, and issued many instructions concerning particular borders to his
chief of boundary negotiation-remarkably, his Kalahom. He instructed his
officials not to accept British maps uncritically, for there might be incorrect
details which could lead to disputes. Yet he disregarded the map done by local
officials for its "incorrectness [since] it was done in Thai style, though it was
somewhat understandable." 40 It is apparent that the boundary he spoke of
was the same kind the British had in mind. But it was not yet the same one as
understood by local Siamese authorities.
The boundary on the Siam-British Burma front was on the agenda again in
the 1870s and 1880s during Chulalongkorn's reign (Rama V, r. 1868-1910).
Two major factors unsettled the matter: the complicated controversy over
the timber industry in the areas along the Salween River and in Lanna, as
well as the fact that the Anglo-Burmese war broke out again for the third and
final time in 1884-1885. A Siamese prince, Phichitpreechakorn, who was
sent to supervise the administration of Chiangmai from 1884, found that
among many urgent tasks he had to inspect the security of the borders and
tighten control over them. He discovered that when the British took over
Burma, they regularly watched over the borders whereas the Lanna local
chiefs always stayed in their towns, waiting for opportunities to attack the
Burmese towns along the borders, plunder them, and force the people back
to Lanna. Phichitpreechakorn thus ordered local authorities to set up new villages right along the borders with a number of guardhouses, fortifications,

Boundary

73

a~d households in each place. Then he prescribed the need for these guardian
villages and local chiefs to inspect the borders regularly-a job unfamiliar to
these people-and ordered them to urgently define the boundary of each area
by whate:er markings. Mo.reover, he called for a meeting oflocal chiefs along
the frontiers. There they signed a declaration of loyalty to the king of Siam
and took an oath of allegiance. In return, they received good-quality cloth
plus the Ratchapataen ("raja's pattern")-the semi-Western-style official suit
used only at the court in Bangkok-and a sum of money before returning to
. dutles.
. 41 Here t he confrontation of different conceptions and practices
t heir
concerning the boundary and border control took place between the
Bangkok authority and local ones. The former was conscious of the differences, perhaps, so all the measures were pragmatic and aimed to establish a
new kind of boundary via traditional practices.
It was the various disputes involving the timber industry that brought
about the first formal Siam-British India treaty signed in January 1874 at
Calcutta to mark the boundary between Lanna and Tenasserim Province
only. 42 But after the final British victory over Ava in 1885, the boundary of
the northern part of Lanna and Upper Burma under British India became a
new questio~. A. team of British and Siamese officials was jointly deputed to
con~u~t an mqmry of local authorities about the boundary in that region.
To mdicate the boundaries, the Bangkok and local delegates tried to use the
same geographical discourse as the British. They handled it very well in most
cases, though they were not quite familiar with it and sometimes used it
awkwardly.
The. Briti.sh .persistently ordered local chiefs to provide any treaty or document Identlfymg the boundaries. As these were friendly neighbors who
shar~d understanding and trust, one local chief replied, the boundary did not
forbid people to trespass or to earn their living in the area. Hence no document had ever been made. According to them, the borders were "golden, silver paths, free for traders." Moreover, it seems that in some cases local chiefs
were ordered t~ pre~are their maps, as one local chief admitted frankly that
the map ';~s still bemg done and would be finished soon. 43 Most confusing
for the. Bntish ~as the fact that a subject of a local authority could be at the
same time a subject of another authority. This posed a problem in judging
';hat belonge.d to whom, since there was usually more than one power exerCised over a giVen people who occupied a certain area. On the other hand the
tribal people wandering in the mountain forests were subjects of no po~er.
Furthermore, what caused the most confusion to the British was the fact that
~or s~me areas such as Muang Sing or Chiang Khaeng, a small town at the
JUnctiOn of Laos, Burma, and China today, the chief and his people belonged

Chapter Three

74

to three overlords at the same time. The first two, Chiangmai and Nan, were
Siam's tributaries, but the last one, Chiang Tung or Kengtung, was a tributary of Burma. The head of the British inquiry wisely conclud~d that ."i~ is a
common town ... since it is not yet decided." 44 We shall constder thts sttuation in the next chapter.

The Nonbounded Kingdom
As we have seen, both Siam and the British talked about boundaries; yet they
referred to different things. For modern people, and very probably for the
British in the story as well, a boundary of a country is a thing generally
understood. Here is a technical definition by a contemporary political geographer:
Located at the interfaces between adjacent state territories, international
boundaries have a special significance in determining the limits of sovereign
authority and defining the spatial form of the contained political regions.
. . . . Boundaries have been loosely described as being linear; in fact they occur
where the vertical interfaces between state sovereignties intersect the surface of the earth.
Frontiers, in contrast, are zonal and therefore contain various geographical features and, frequently, populations. As vertical interfaces, boundaries have no
horizontal extent ... 45
Or as an authority on political geography sums it up: "Boundary refers ~o a
line while frontier refers to a zone." 46 For political geographers, the notwns
of "frontier" and "border" are the same, that is, a zoneY It is likely that the
British in our story held this concept too, though the one in their head might
not have been so technical as the definition cited above.
Siam, however, was not yet in the same world order and was not yet
obliged to abide by such European inventions as a fixed national boun~ary
and the laws and customs associated with it. But this did not mean that Starn
had no knowledge of the extremity of its sovereign territory. In fact, in the
Bangkok Thai language there were many words that had meanings similar to
boundary-namely, khopkhet, khetdaen, anakhet, khopkhanthasima, and others.
The words khop and khet mean edge, rim, fringe, or limit. The word daen
means area, territory.
In Khun Prasert-aksonnit's 1891 Photchananukrom (Dictionary), there are
many words denoting area, country, district, or township, but none for
48
boundary or limit. The word anakhet means the areas under control. In Pallegoix's 1854 edition of his English-Thai dictionary the ':ords a~ac~ak: ~he­
tanachak, and anakhet mean "limits of the kingdom to whtch the JUnsdtctlon

Boundary

75

extends, the power of the king," "limits of the kingdom," and "borders surrounding the whole kingdom, domination over the whole kingdom," respectively. 49 In the 1896 edition, these translations are the same. But there appear
the words khet, khopkhet, and khetkhanthasima meaning "limits," "limits all
around," and "boundary of the kingdom," respectively. 50 Bradley's 1873 dictionary, a Thai-Thai dictionary published between the two Pallegoix editions, has no term anakhet. The word khopkhet means areas in the huamuang
(provincial areas), the outermost areas of a kingdom. 51
It is evident that Siam did not lack the terminology and concepts for dealing with the British proposals for boundaries. But considering these definitions closely, we can see that none of them meant exactly the boundary that
the British had in mind. To point out only one basic discrepancy, all of the
terms tend to signify areas, districts, or frontiers, not boundary lines. They
mean a limit-an extremity without a clear-cut edge and without the sense of
division between two powers. It is in these terms that Siam understood the
British request for a boundary. Hence it is likely that the court was by no
means surprised by the British requests but in fact had its own referent .
What were the characteristics of the premodern boundary in Siam's conception? First of all, it was not determined or sanctioned by the central
authority. To designate a boundary was probably an unthinkable mission for
the Phrakhlang. Nor was it an interesting job for the king of Chiangmai.
Rather, it was something the British could do by themselves if they wished
or with the help of the local people since it was their responsibility-the
guards, hunters, and local inhabitants who earned their living by collecting
honey or hunting elephants-to protect the borders.
Second, the khetdaen of each town was determined primarily by the extent
of surrounding area it could protect. A town may or may not have a common
border connecting it with another town, let alone a line dividing the realms
of two towns or countries. As a conglomeration of towns, a kingdom was
composed of political-territorial patches with a lot of blank space in between.
Third, the khetdaen of a kingdom extended to the extremity of these outlying towns and the areas over which their power could be exercised. Beyond
these limits there could be vast areas of forests and mountains forming a corridor between the two kingdoms. It was a border without boundary line. Or
one could say that it was a "thick line" with a broad horizontal extent.
Fourth, it was not the whole border which was regarded as the area under
one's sovereignty and hence the area under control. As the Siamese court
wrote in a letter of 28 August 1845, only "whenever there are roads or passes
employed by travellers, there are built watch houses for the protection of said
roads and places." 52 It was these passages to, and through, the thick forests

76

Chapter Three

and mountainous borders that were meant when Siam talked about boundaries. That is to say, these places-not even a whole frontier zone, let alone a
"line" -were worth mentioning or guarding and were marked out as the
furthest distance under the responsibility of certain local authorities. Only
this sort of place could be marked by trees or piles of stones.
53
This kind of marking is noted in many historical records. Two wellknown passages between Siam and Burma, the Three Pagoda Pass and the
Singkhon Pass, which were mentioned in most records of wars between the
two countries, are also khetdaen of this kind. The three pagodas were not in
54
fact pagodas but huge piles of stones intentionally constructed. They were
markings of the limit. In many historical records, the word khetdaen is
mentioned when referring to a path or a passage-such as the words of
a Lanna local chief about khetdaen being a golden, silver path cited earlier.
If the marking was a line, it could be a short line covering only the
vicinity of the passage. This was the case when a boundary between
Chiangmai and a Kayah state was ritually marked by a bull track at the top
of a hill. 55
As a consequence, only the inhabited areas or the passageways, regarded as
limits, were protected by local guards. Thus a guardhouse was also a sign of
the extremity of a sovereign power over a particular domain. Remarkably,
since no boundary was recognized by Bangkok, the position of a guardhouse
and the distance the guard patrolled defined the extent of space under the sovereignty of Bangkok-whereas in modern times the extent of sovereign territory marked by a boundary line delimits the space of a border patrol's authority. Each portion of this boundary was prescribed independently by local
authority. It might or might not connect to another portion of boundary.
Thus the "boundaries" of a kingdom were discontinuous and, therefore, the
kingdom was nonbounded.
Fifth, in some areas, however, a guardhouse meant nothing since the people of both sides were allowed to travel through the areas between the two
frontier towns or settle indiscriminately there. In the joint inquiry of boundaries between Lanna and Upper Burma, the British officials were puzzled by
the fact that many Shan subjects of Kengtung settled near Chiang Saen, a
frontier township of Chiangmai. The Siamese official replied that they were
not forbidden to do so, and whether they settled there or not did not matter.
In this case, owing to the fact that Chiangmai and Kengtung were not hostile to each other at the time, there was no need to keep watch or to seize the
people of the other side. As a result, whether there were many Shan subjects
of Kengtung in the forest close to Chiang Saen or not,

we don't know, because we regard the town's walls the most important. The
~earb~ ~reas are branches of the anakhet. Whether those Ngieo [Shan] are hidmg, hvmg, or earning their living, we do not look around .... The water~hed on that big mountain is an approximate boundary. But the town is more
Important than inhabitants. 56
Sixth, if a corridor border ran between hostile countries, people of one side
were allowed to earn their living in the corridor but were not allowed to trespass ontc the areas under the other's authority. In this case, the guards'
patrol zones were significant and had to be defined. In our modern definitio~, a frontier or border is a zone which lies along each side of the boundary
~r mterfaces a neighboring country-that is, a boundary is in between two
sides of borders. But from the account of the Siamese notion of a boundary, it
appears that a huge border was between both sides' boundaries of authority.
In shor.t, even for Siam alone there was more than one kind of geopolitical
extre~uty. One was the boundary of sovereign authority which was, geograp~Ic~lly speakin.g, well inside the border. The other was the border beyond
the hmit of sovereign authority and without boundary. Sovereignty and border were not coterminous.
Seventh, it was the boundary of sovereign authority that could be defined
~ithout the agreement or ratification of another country. The boundary of a
kmgdom was of this kind, so it was not necessary to be joined to anotherleaving the corridor border outside the boundaries belonging to neither. In
fact, when the Siamese court at the end of Rama III's reign talked about the
boundary between Tenasserim and Siam, it said that after the Anglo-Burma
war was over, "the boundary [of Tenasserim] was extended to join the one of
Siam." 57 ~he words precisely reflected this idea. In short, the sovereignty of
the two kmgdoms was normally set apart without interface.
Eighth, just as open or closed borders signify the health of relations
b~tween two countries in modern times, border relations in premodern times
did so as well, but in a different manner. On the one hand, there was the
"go~den, silver path" which never prevented people from traveling across it,
earnmg their living on it, or even settling close to one another's frontier
towns without permission. On the other hand, there was the border where
the enemy was forbidden to trespass. Generally the rivals preferred to leave
space unsettled since it served as a buffer keeping a distance between them.
On an unfriendly border it was the duty of local officials to monitor the
e~emy's movements by undertaking spying missions into the opponent's ternt.ory. At the same time they had to guard the boundary against the enemy's
spies. Perhaps the British accusation that the Siamese guards had gone onto

r
Chapter Three

78

their territory was not entirely groundless. Yet the marking ~f their s~r~~il­
lance point or the religious shrine marking the extent of their r~sponsibihty
were not boundary marks. On a friendly border, however, as m the early
years of the reign, the practice was opposite: "Nowadays, Thai and British
are friends. [We] do not have to look after our khetdaen as previo~s~~ when
facing the Burmese."SB For friendly countries, therefore, a prohibitiOn on
trespassing as the British prescribed was not welcome. It was_ p_robably seen as
an unfriendly act since it was traditionally a step short of seizmg ~h: _enemy.
This is why the court was annoyed by the British ban. The prohibitiOn also
caused confusion among the local people, who were used to traveling across
the boundary without permission in the case of friendly borders. Local people
were accustomed to visiting their relatives on both sides of the border; some
even migrated from one side to the other from time to time. This has been
true for all borders from the Pakchan River to northernmost Lanna.
Furthermore, not only the prohibition on trespassing but also the request
to pinpoint a boundary might well have been seen by Siam as a sign of
unfriendliness, though the two countries were still on good terms. In 1829,
requested by the British governor of Penang to mark out the boundary of
Kedah and Wellesley Province at a time when relations between the two
countries were very good, especially between himself and many British
authorities, the ruler of Nakhon was evidently stunned by such a request:
Whereas we have always been well inclined to the British, and never charged
them with any evil intention in any of our letters, why has our friend sent a letter enquiring about the boundaries of the territories at which we are very much
astonished?
Wherefore we have sent Khun Akorn with a letter to our friend in order
that he may enquire in a friendly manner, what are our friend's intentions in
doing this ?59

And in another case when the British accused a Siamese local authority of
planting a flag over British territory as a mark of boundary, the Siamese court
replied with these words: "The Siamese never sent any pe:son or persons to
plant a flag .... It is against all rules and customs of the Siamese to send and
plant flags and point out boundaries." 60
.
This may explain why the early British requests were poorly received and
sometimes provoked dissatisfaction. When the attitude of Siam toward the
British had changed, however, urgent requests from the British recei_ve~
prompt response-positive in British eyes but given by Siam with much untation. It should be noted here that the replies of cooperation from the court
were accompanied by a number of separate letters denying all the charges

Boundary

79

made by the British about Siam's incursion into their territory. In some of
these letters, counteraccusations were put forward. Moreover, it was at this
time that the court proposed to have a boundary of the kind which would
keep a distance between the two countries. It is likely that the British
requests for clear boundary lines with modern rules of border control came
close to the behavior of unfriendly neighbors. 6t
From all of these observations, then, we may see numerous boundaries
w~ich might ~ot be connected but which were flexible. Some might be
thick, some mtght be blurred. Many had disappeared or never existed. Siam
before the last decade of the nineteenth century was not like "an old axe "
but a discontinuous, patchy arrangement of power units where people of different_ overlords mingled together in the same area while only spies were
workmg close to the frontier towns of one another. And those areas far from
t~e cent_er of a kingdom might be generously given away for the sake of
fnendship. In this case, the border would shrink a bit. It did not matter. In
fact, throughout Southeast Asian tradition, as one scholar remarks "marginal territorial concessi~ns were not viewed as fatal to the kingdom. ~s long
as the essence of sovereignty [the center] was unimpaired, such concessions
were a legitimate instrument of policy."62
The sphere_of'a realJ_TI or the limits of a kingdom could be defined only by
those townshtps allegiance to the center of a kingdom. The political sphere
could be mapped only by power relationships, not by territorial integrity.
~hus to talk about the frontiers of a sovereign unit-anakhet, khopkhanthasm~a-meant those marginal authorities in the remote townships or those
chtefdoms at the margin of the sphere of power rather than the frontier space
itself.
The British attempt to demarcate the boundary induced confrontations
between different concepts of political space. This confrontation, however,
went unrecognized by both sides because they used words that seemed to
deno_te the same thing. The words "boundary" and khetdaen, or anakhet and
the h~e, seemed to be generally translatable. But in fact they confronted each
other m every event of communication at the level of the signifying process.
The British pushed a concept of "boundary" whose qualification was different from that of khetdaen. By doing so, the conception of khetdaen held
by Siam was disturbed while the concept of "boundary" imposed itself as
an alternative of signification. In other words, the "boundary" proposed its
c~n~e~t as a compatible message through the compatible terminology. The
stgmfter became ambiguous, signifying different concepts at the same time.
This situation resulted in changing practices-mixing up the practices of the
two concepts until an outcome could be determined. Certainly the rules gov-



Chapter Three

erning such practices were disturbed and changed as well. By agreeing to be
involved in practices relating to the concept of "boundary," they already
allowed the new rules and practices to be established. The more they agreed
with British requests, the more their customary practices related to khetdaen
were shaken, changed, and moved toward the stipulations of the British.
It was the elite of Mongkut's generation who consciously adopted the
alternative concept and its rules and practices, including the methods of
marking boundary lines in the modern sense and the use of maps. Although
differences in conceptions still prevailed at other levels of the community,
particularly among those people along the frontiers, it was not long before
the Bangkok regime tightened its control over the borders and by clever tactics-playing on the ignorance of local subjects by employing a traditional
ritual of allegiance, for example-stipulated practices which half a century
earlier it had not known.

Chapter Four

Sovereignty

THE TERRITORIAL DELIMITATION of Siam was much more complicated when a
border was not a corridor but a frontier town regarded as common to more
than one kingdom. A modern boundary was not possible until what belonged to whose realm had been sorted out. But the premodern polity defied
such a modern undertaking. Confrontations and controversies over the question of what today we might call "sovereignty" over the Shan states, Lanna,
Cambodia, the Malay states, and the left bank of the Mekhong were critical
to the formation of the modern Thai state and its misunderstood history.

Hierarchical Interstate Relations

Figure 20. "Wake Up, Thai People" (By permission of Conrad Taylor)

In premodern polities the relationship between political powers was hierarchical. A ruler whose authority prevailed over several local rulers or chiefs of
tiny townships, mostly in nearby areas, was submissive to another lord. This
pattern of relations prevailed all the way up the pyramid to the most powerful kingship of the realm. Lieberman suggests that even in the supposedly
most integrated period of Burmese history, the reign of Bayinnaung (15511581), the relationship between the central and local rulers was primarily one
of personal subordination under the "High King." The kings of major
towns, bayin, still held limited power and kingly regalia. The kingdom held
together as long as personal subordination to the supreme king remained. 1 In
Thai, the unit of status in this hierarchy was indiscriminately called muang,
which meant the governed area-that is, the area under the righteous protection of the overlord.
This pattern applied also to the relationship among several kingdoms,
including the one between a regional major kingdom like Siam or Burma and
its tributary kingdoms such as Lanna, Lan Sang, and the Malay states. Funda-

81

82

Chapter Four

mentally, these tributaries were regarded as separate kingdoms, that is, separate networks of hierarchical lordship. Not only did each king of these tributaries regard himself as the lord of his realm, but the supreme overlord of the
region also tolerated a tributary king with little interference. Each king had
his own court, administrative and financial system, tax collection, army, and
judicial system. We might say that these lesser kingdoms were generally
regarded as having their own sovereignty. Nevertheless, the interstate relations in this region operated by common recognition of the hierarchical
world order in which the supreme overlord-because his highest store of
merit could be expressed if necessary in terms of force-cast his influence over
the inferior kingships. A tributary inevitably had to submit itself to the
supreme overlord, recognizing its own inferior status. Based on this world
order, consequently, the supreme overlord could enforce his demand or intervene in the affairs of the inferior kingdom whenever he deemed it legitimate.
Yet the overlord's store of merit could suddenly expire-hence the decline of
his power and legitimacy. In that situation the overlordship might be defied
by its tributaries or even challenged by another contending overlord-hence
chaos or disorder in the interstate hierarchy. Inevitably the uncertainty of
hierarchy relations had to be decided by a concrete measure: a battle. A tributary might dissociate itself from any overlord for a while or might cooperate
with another overlord until the order was resumed in one way or another;
then it would be forced to enter the tributary relationship again. In Thai a
tributary was called prathetsarat. This scheme of power relations in Southeast
Asian polity has been known to scholars as mandala. As 0. W. Wolters who
proposed this terminology has put it:
[The] mandala represented a particular and often unstable political situation in a
vaguely definable geographical area without fixed boundaries and where
smaller centers tended to look in all directions for security. Mandalas would
expand and contract in concertina-like fashion. Each one contained several tributary rulers, some of whom would repudiate their vassal status when the
opportunity arose and try to build up their own networks of vassals. 2

The tributary relationship had its forms of obligations, sanctions, and allegiance. The most important obligation was the ritual of submission. A tributary had to send a mission of tribute payment to the supreme overlord regularly, mostly annually or triennially, as a sign of commitment to renew the
allegiance. Although money and valuable goods were always included in a
tribute, the principal tribute was the gold and silver tree-the Bunga mas in
Malay, small trees fashioned from gold and silver leaves. In return the overlord would honor a tributary ruler with gifts of greater value.

Sovereignty

83

Another important sanction was the appointment of a tributary ruler who
had to be approved and conferred by the overlord. This custom always
included the ritual of submission from a new tributary ruler, who in return
received the regalia, gifts, and the golden parchment of his title conferment.
Normally, the supreme king had nothing to do with the succession of a tributary throne, whether it was hereditary or usurped. Only in certain circumstances would the overlord intervene and dictate the outcome. Thus the
appointment was on the one hand a sanction by the supreme lord to his inferior kingship, while on the other hand it was a means to guarantee the allegiance of tributaries. In addition, a tributary was obliged to send manpower,
troops, goods, money, or other supplies whenever the overlord required.
This obligation was significant in terms of material assistance, especially in
times of war, as well as a sign of loyalty.
Any attempt to escape these duties, especially the ritual of submission, was
a sign of defiance to the overlordship-hence an intent to rebel. In fact, a
large number of wars in the history of this region were not contests between
rival kingdoms but wars of punishment waged by a supreme lord against the
defiance of tributaries. The scale of destruction varied. Some merely forced
the replacement of a tributary's ruler; others were no less catastrophic than
the battles fought between hostile kingdoms.
The rationale of this relationship has been explained as the necessity of a
weaker state to seek protection from a more powerful one as security against
the greed of another overlord; in return the weaker state had to repay the
benevolence of the protector. Hence it was a reciprocal relation. Yet the fierce
punishment meted out to any tributary that wished to quit the relationship
indicated that the relationship was far from one of mutual agreement or the
relation sought by the weaker. In Thai the manner in which a tributary
entered this relationship was described as khopen kha-khopkhanthasima, to
request to be under the holy sphere of the supreme power, or thawai
sawamiphak, to give full loyalty to. It meant that, for example, Bangkok had
to protect its tributaries from the aggression of any other supreme lord such
as Burma or Vietnam and, if requested, from any revolt against a tributary
ruler. Thus the submission was voluntary and protection was requested.
Although this reasoning is not wrong, it is a half-truth. The notion of protection in this relationship had another meaning.
In the Theravada Buddhist polity of the region, the righteous kingship,
the universal monarch or cakravatin, was obliged to protect the religion from
declining. Protecting the religion and the quest for supremacy were one and
the same mission. 3 A powerful Bangkok king had to fight to expand his
umbrella of merit and righteousness, dharma, as far as possible to bring the

Chapter Four

84

lesser kingdoms under the protection of his supreme merit. And it would be
wrong to leave those weaker kings unprotected since they might fall into the
domain of evil. The acquisition of tributaries in itself became a sign of
supremacy. Success in preventing tributaries' disobedience, or quitting their
allegiance, or being taken over by another supreme power, therefore,
reflected the status of this supremacy. In other words, it was a self-presumed
protector who sought the protected to fulfill his own desire to become a
cakravatin. In this sense the protection was imposed, not requested.
The conventional notion implies that the danger came from a third party,
either another kingdom or an internal revolt. But according to the other
notion of protection, the threat came from nowhere but the supreme overlord himself, who forced a weaker state to become and remain his protected
tributary. A submission, in this circumstance, was unavoidably compulsory
rather than voluntary. The two notions coexisted and were manifested by
the same practice. In other words, the practice of tributary relations was
ambiguous.
The cases of the Malay states and Cambodia will show the different circumstances in which they entered into tributary relationships. In some cases,
the oppressive protection was imposed and the tributaries hardly had any
choice. In other cases, however, factional disputes within a tributary court
led to the request for protection from one or more overlords. In some situations, nevertheless, a tributary sought an overlord to counter pressure from
another overlord.

Shared Sovereignty: A Strategy for Survival
Cambodia was a powerful kingdom along the southern part of the Mekhong.
It was situated between two more powerful kingdoms, however, Siam and
Vietnam. Since its decline in the fourteenth century, Cambodia had been a
tributary of the Siamese kingdom of Ayudhya. The situation became worse
from the seventeenth century onward as Vietnam grew stronger and
demanded submission from Cambodia. Caught in between, Cambodia had
no choice but to accept the overlordship of both superior neighbors. 4
The contest between Siam and Vietnam over Cambodia was further intensified and complicated by factional fighting within the Cambodian court
from the late eighteenth century to the first half of the nineteenth. Whenever
a faction sought support from one overlord, the loser sought the other's protection. As factional disputes for the throne intensified, both overlords interfered with the Cambodian court through the polarized factions. 5 Not only
were there tribute payments and other obligations such as the recognition of

Sovereignty

85

the Cambodian king by both Bangkok and Hue, but both superpowers stationed their troops in the Cambodian realm. 6
In this desperate relationship, the Cambodian kings had always attempted
to create a balance of the overlord's power by blurring the line of allegiance in
order to make the realm somehow independent. 7 Cambodia in this relationship was perhaps best characterized by a Vietnamese emperor, Gia Long, in a
letter to King Rama II of Siam in 1811 begging his pardon on behalf of King
Uthairacha who had fled to Saigon, then Gia Dinh, after the dispute with his
heir who had fled to Bangkok:
[The Cambodian king) has depended on both [Siam] and Vietnam for a long
time. The Thai king is like his Father and the Vietnamese one like his Mother.
Now [King] Uthairacha has committed an offense against his Father, then
requested his Mother to beg for the Father's pardon; I could not simply abandon him. So, I write for Your Majesty's pardon. 8
The feud between Father and Mother themselves increasingly grew out of
the disputes among their protected Sons, and finally a war broke out in 1834
which lasted for fourteen years. By the time the parental feud was exhausted,
Cambodia lay devastated and neither side could claim victory. The outcome
of the reconciliation was the return to the status quo that existed before the
war. The Cambodian king had a clear view of this outcome: "Please let me
be subjected to the merit and power of both great kingdoms, so that my people can live in peace and happiness." 9
For Siam, King Rama III regarded the outcome as a success in the sense
that "[Vietnam] took our Cambodia ... 36 years ago. Only now have we
got it back. " 1° Chandler regards this outcome as the restoration of Cambodian
"independence." 11 Cambodia's independence in 1847 was not much different
from the situation earlier in 1811, however, when the best summary was
made by Gia Long: Cambodia was, in Chandler's translation, "an independent country that is slave of two." 12
For the northern Malay states, the circumstance surrounding their predicament was slightly different. Although they were merely small, disunified
principalities, their geographical position was far removed from the supreme
powers and thus they were not involved in a confrontation between those
overlords. Hence they had more room to maneuver and their strategy to
restrain the pressure from Siam was more adventurous. Nevertheless, the
outcome was not much different.
Historically, the raja of Kedah was engaged in ongoing struggles against
other Malay neighbors and powerful rivals in the region, such as Malacca and
Aceh, in order to maintain his own rule. In the 1650s the conflict with the

r

86

Chapter Four

Dutch, then a maritime power in the region, left Kedah with no choice but
to seek assistance from Siam by sending the Bunga mas, the gold and silver
tree, to Ayudhya. Kedah was regarded by Siam as a tributary ever since.
Throughout the rest of the seventeenth century, Kedah survived by alternately seeking help from either the Dutch or Siam to hold one another off.
The raja had successfully preserved, to some extent, his independent rulership.13
The rise of Ava, a Burmese power, and the fall of Ayudhya in the late eighteenth century meant that Kedah could dissociate from Siam. But Ava asked
for Kedah's submission. Kedah sent a Bunga mas mission to Ava. Worse,
Siam quickly recovered and wanted to resume its overlordship over the former tributaries of Ayudhya. As Bonney tells us, the raja of Kedah wisely
"kept peace with both, paying homage sometimes to one and sometimes to
the other and often to both." 14
The Siamese overlordship increased for two reasons. First was the factional
fighting for the throne of Kedah, especially in 1803, when a faction requested
the presence of Siamese forces. 15 Second, acting as the prime agency of
Bangkok to look after Siam's interest over the Malay states, Nakhon actively
expanded its power into Kedah for the sake of its own self-interest, beyond
Bangkok's supervision or orders. 16 Nakhon's actions, however, led to disobedience and revolts from time to time against SiamY Consequently, a raja of
Kedah was ousted by Nakhon's force in 1821.
A similar situation existed in Kelantan, Trengganu, and Perak. The rajas
of these petty states ruled their realms autonomously, but had to comply
with the burden of demands from Siam. The protection was far from welcome, except when a support for the throne was needed, but a struggle for
independence was perhaps unthinkable yet. To avoid punishment from the
overlords, the practice of multiple submissions was necessary. Instead of getting rid of all foreign suzerains, a raja needed to cultivate another power's
interest in his realm in order to restrain the Siamese overlordship. So when
the British company, a new power in the regional maritime trade, was looking for a station in that area, it was invited by Kedah to locate there.
The leases of the port of Kuala in 1772 and Penang in 1785 and the cession
of Wellesley in 1800 to the British were more than real estate transactions for
money. They were done in the context of the indigenous interstate politics of
the late eighteenth century. They were regarded by Kedah as contractual
obligations whereby the British would provide protection to Kedah in case of
threats from Siam or Burma, particularly Nakhon's ambition. Again, a similar strategy was adopted by Perak, Kelantan, and Trengganu. 18 Perak even
offered its realm to the British as a guarantee for help in the event of Siam's

Sovereignty

87

intervention. 19 Unfortunately, the British were ignorant of these tributary
politics; the politics they knew had different rules; the offers of these rajas
were mostly accepted but their wishes were turned down.
The cases of Cambodia and the Malay states show clearly the dilemma
these tributaries faced and the delicacy of the strategies they adopted in dealing with pressures from the supreme overlords. The protection was unwelcome oppression and yet it was an alternative to the oppression at the same
time. It was a third hand in factional disputes and yet it always turned out to
be a mailed fist. Even for the struggle within the Siamese court, for example,
in 1874, the British consul was requested to interfere. With patriotism yet
unborn, foreign interventions were sometimes welcomed as protection
among the ruling people. It was a significant strategy for survival. 20
Strikingly, most of the interactions in these interkingdom relationships
operated via the medium of gifts, especially tribute and the gold and silver
trees. In fact, the ambiguity of tributary relationships was also expressed
through the ambiguous meanings of tribute. In the light of one of Marcel
Mauss's classic works, The Gift, the gift exchange in premodern societies was
a means of communicating certain messages about the kinds, levels, and circumstances of the relations between the giver and the recipient. 21 In premodern Southeast Asia, various gifts were perhaps codes which could be decoded
according to the rules of their interstate relations. This may explain why the
documents of relations among these kingdoms and with the West always
recorded details of gifts given or received. The point here, however, is that
there is a paradox in the archaic practice of gift exchange: "The gift is both
apparently disinterested and always interested, apparently voluntary and
essentially involuntary."22
In the case of Siam, even though the Siamese envoys had always performed
the ritual of submission, the tribute mission to the Chinese emperor has been
explained by most modern scholars of Thailand as a profit-making enterprise,
not a sign of submission, since the Chinese emperor always rewarded the Siamese with commodities of greater value that were salable in the market. 23
Paradoxically the tribute, the gold and silver trees in particular, from an inferior state to Siam was always regarded as evidence of submission. The giver,
such as Kedah, however, might similarly deny such a hegemonic interpretation, arguing that it was a token of alliance and friendship, "a mere exchange
of civility," and nothing beyond that. 24
In the tributary relationship, the tribute could be the token for protection
of both kinds. It might signify unavoidable submission in order to keep peace
with an overlord in one case or merely a ploy in another circumstance. It was
simultaneously problem and solution, oppression and alternative, compulsory

r
Chapter Four

88

and voluntary, forced duty and survival tactic, depending on intentions, circumstances, and points of view of both giver and recipient (historians as well
take one side or another).
Rulers of tributary states played with the ambiguity of protection and tribute payment as a strategy for survival. Though they could not prevent the
imposed mafia-like protection, they could resist by using the same mediumtributes and gifts-to obtain protection from another power. The tributary
relationship remained fluid as long as power and resistance occurred within
the same relations and practices. Moreover, unlike the modern concept of a
sovereign state, a tributary's overt and formal submission did not prevent it
from attempting to preserve its own autonomy or "independence," nor did
the quest for autonomy prevent a state from submitting itself to more than
one supreme power at any one time. Indeed, the practice of multiple submissions was often indispensable if the state was to save its "independence." The
tragic side of this strategy was that such a tributary would be regarded by
each overlord as its own possession. It appears that both Siam and Vietnam
claimed suzerainty over Cambodia while the Cambodian monarch always
considered himself independent. The same could be said of Kedah, which was
free to give away Penang and Wellesley in exchange for another balancing
power, yet which was a customary victim of Siam's imposed protection. The
sovereignty over each tributary state was not usurped by the overlords, nor
was its realm encroached upon as in modern colonialism. The sovereignty of
a state in this premodern polity was neither single nor exclusive. It was multiple and capable of being shared-one for its own ruler, another for its overlord-not in terms of a divided sovereignty but rather a sovereignty of
hierarchical layers. And this was what the British inquirer described as the
"common" muang.

Multiple Sovereignty and the Europeans
Although tacit "influence" over another state is a part of international politics today, the sovereignty of a state must, formally, be exclusive, not
hierarchical or multiple, and it must be unambiguous. Even a colony is
regarded as an integral part of the sovereignty of an imperial country. Thus in
the eyes of the European in the nineteenth century it had to be decided
whether a particular tributary was independent or was an integral part or a
colony of another kingdom-not somewhere between independent and
dependent nor somehow possessed by more than one kingdom at the same
time. The ambiguous nature of the tributary relationship misleads even the
historians of our time, since the notion of prathetsarat had already been dis-

Sovereignty

89

placed by a new Thai word coined during the 1930s and 1940s: ananikhom,
which denotes a colonyship in modern polity. 25 An authority on Thai history
has attempted to classify the status of these tributaries in terms of the degree
of independence/ dependence as semi-independent, principality, quasi-independent, and peripheral center. 26 Another authority on modern Siam even
regards the tributaries as provinces of Siam. 27
In the case of the Malay states in the nineteenth century, several misunderstandings occurred among British colonial officials themselves, as well as
between them and Siam and the Malay rulers. The problem arose as early as
1821 when Nakhon's forces invaded Kedah. The raja of Kedah asked the
British for protection. He was rejected. The raja then accused the British of
breaking the obligation (implied by the leases of Penang and Wellesley).
Finally he was ousted and the British did not intervene.
The British were confused by the ambiguity of the tributary relationship:
was Kedah independent or a dependency of Siam? If it was a dependency, the
attack on Kedah was an internal affair in which they should not interfere, let
alone help Kedah. But in this case the leases of Penang and Wellesley according to the treaties with Kedah in 1786 and 1802 were void without Siam's
ratification. If Kedah was independent, on the other hand, the leases were
valid but the action of Nakhon must be taken as an invasion and therefore
counteracted. The arguments among British officials themselves centered on
the question whether the Bunga mas was compulsory or voluntary: did it
indicate the submission of the giver to the recipient or was it merely a token
of respect from a less powerful state who was free to enter or terminate the
relations at will, as the raja of Kedah had argued? A historian has noted:
"Truth appears to lie somewhere between these two extreme views." 28 Or,
more precisely, truth lay in both of them together, interchangeably.
Moreover, the British wondered whether treaties with Kedah implied an
obligation to protect Kedah. Again, this question focused on the implications
of gift exchange-in this case the leases-in indigenous custom. On all questions, the tributary relationship and the practice of gift exchange divided
British colonial officials into two factions; each supported one interpretation
and proposed policies accordingly. In the first half of the century, any
involvement with native politics was deemed undesirable. 29 Of course the
British company preferred the interpretation that the leases were legal but
implied no obligation of alliance with Kedah. No such obligation was mentioned in any agreement, they argued, totally overlooking the indigenous
view of gift exchange. Not only was the 1821 event which disturbed the
region accepted with no interference, but it also alarmed the British that their
presence there might be questioned by Siam as well. One of the tasks of John

Crawfurd's mission to Siam that year was to find out Siam's view on the
validity of the treaties with Kedah and the British presence.
Eventually Crawfurd was surprised but delighted that the issue was not
questioned. He concluded his report, with his undoubtedly European legal
rationale, that Siam's thirty-seven-year silence was substantial evidence of the
recognition of British rights. 30 Ironically, for some decades after the Crawfurd report, it was the British, not the Siamese, who still had doubts over the
validity of the treaties with Kedah, since the status of Kedah with respect to
Siam was never clear to them. One finally suggested that even though Kedah
was a dependency of Siam, the leases were made with the (mis)understanding
that it was independent. The occupation of Penang and Wellesley was, in his
word, an "error," but the rights obtained by occupation were later recognized by Siam. Strikingly, in his argument, since the ruler of Nakhon was a
high-ranking Siamese noble, the agreement about the boundary demarcation
in 1833 was regarded by the legal-minded British as the first substantial legal
evidence of British rights over Penang and WellesleyY
Another confusion over the tributary relationship, even more complex,
was made evident by the events surrounding the invasion of Perak, another
Malay state, by Nakhon's force in 1826. One task of the Burney mission in
1825-1826 was to negotiate a guarantee that Siam would not send troops
into the Malay states under any circumstances. He achieved that aim without
having to sort out the ambiguity of the dependent/independent status of
those states. 32 Siam agreed on condition that the British would not prevent
the Malay states from performing the Bunga mas ritual as usual. Considering
the state of confused knowledge among the British at that time, it is hard to
blame Burney for such a contradictory compromise. Nonetheless, it is not
surprising that the treaty was the subject of both strong criticism and strong
support among the British. 33 They agreed only on the idea that the Bunga
mas should not be interpreted as a token of submission to Bangkok. Hence in
the British view, Siam had no right to interfere in the affairs of the Malay
states. 34 For other Malay states, namely Kelantan and Trengganu, the British
reached similar agreements with Siam. 35 Both parties were unaware that the
agreement was based on misunderstanding.
Shortly after the Burney treaty was concluded, Nakhon sent a small armed
force to Perak asking for the Bunga mas. Captain James Low was one of the
pro-Malay faction among the Penang authorities but considered the Bunga
mas as a token of submission, so he urged Perak to show its independence by
defying Nakhon's demand. Moreover, without authorization, he signed a
treaty on behalf of the British company recognizing Perak as an independent
state. Assuming that the British had become its protector by Low's treaty,

91

Perak drove Nakhon's force back. In doing so Perak informed the Siamese
that the British would take its side. But after learning of the incident, the
British authority at Penang rejected such an understanding, saying that there
was no such obligation. Ironically, Nakhon was held off. Perak was told that
it would no longer be disturbed by force, but it was still a tributary of Siam.
Perak agreed, saying that nothing had changed in the relationship between
Perak and Siam. Indeed, Perak applauded the Siamese-British agreements.
Perak had already achieved its aim of using the British to hold off Siam,
despite British refusal to help. Thanks to the complex and confused misunderstandings, the incident was over. 36
It seems that Siam regarded the agreement not to send troops to the Malay
states as a separate issue from the fact that they were tributaries of Siam.
Thus the Siamese court did not quite understand the British position on
Perak. As late as 1850, they complained to another British envoy to the
court, Sir James Brooke, that Perak used to be a tributary to Siam which paid
the Bunga mas to Siam but was then taken over by PenangY This claim
might have been denied by the British at the time, but the complaint reflected
how the court understood British-Perak relations. How can one expect the
court to have interpreted the relationship between Perak and the British in
any other way but as a "protection" of the former by the latter?
Protection? Many rajas of Kedah had learned, time after time, that the
British did not abide by the implied obligation of gifts. The British could sacrifice t~e~r ill-fated ally for the peace of the region (read: trade in the region).
The Bntt~h preferred not to be hostile to Siam at the expense of Kedah. They
were anxwus that if they did not actively cooperate with Siam, Siam's dissatisfaction might affect their presence at Penang and Wellesley. Twice, in 1831
and 1838, when the ex-raja's loyalists attempted to restore him to the throne,
the ~ritis~ sent gunboats to blockade the mouth of the Kedah River, directly
helpmg Starn to suppress the revolts. 38 Kedah's cession of Penang and Wellesley did not work, for the legal-minded British, to hold off Siam's interference. The British had acquired good ports and did not want anything that
might harm trade. As Bonney puts it, the wishes of the raja turned out to be
"the grand illusion."39
These cases show the misunderstanding caused by confrontations between
the indigenous tributary relationship and the rationalistic European view of
modern international relations. Moreover, the requests for protection by
these Malay states did give the British an opportunity to claim them as their
possessions. Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, in the best
intere_st of their trade in the region, the British held a noninterference policy.
In domg so they left intact the ambiguity of sovereignty over these tributar-

92

ies. The French were confronted with a similar ambiguity concerning indigenous tributary relationships. Instead of leaving the ambiguity undecided,
however, it seems that the French were aware of the situation and exploited
it to fulfill their aims in Indochina.
Like their British counterparts, the French first acknowledged the influence of Siam over Cambodia and were reluctant to interfere with its domestic
politics. 40 They even refused to lend a hand to a faction of the Cambodian
court which, following a palace struggle in 1861, asked for French protection.41 Later, however, it is clear that they were aware of the other side of the
ambiguity-that is, the autonomy of a tributary kingdom. When the first
agreement between French Indochina and Cambodia was drawn up in 1863
without Siam's knowledge, Siam lodged a protest. The French navy commander replied legalistically that Cambodia was a sovereign, independent
country and could therefore negotiate a treaty with Cochin China without
consulting any other country. 42
The nineteen-article treaty in 1863 making Cambodia a French protectorate was considered by France and later historians as a landmark in this colonial relationship. Yet Siam and Cambodia at that time might not have understood the treaty in the same sense-not because of an anti-imperialist idea but
because they perceived such agreements in a different conceptual framework.
In fact, despite the treaty, the French did not forbid Cambodia to maintain its
tributary relationship with Siam, including the custom of tribute payment. 43
In the following year, 1864, they even invited Siam to participate in the coronation ceremony of Cambodia's King Norodom. 44 Here Mongkut, in a letter
to Norodom, describes what the French consul had explained to the Siamese
court about the whole situation:
Monsieur Aubaret, the French consul ... suggested that both [Siam] and
France should together crown the king of Cambodia. This follows the example
of [the previous kings of Cambodia), who received the golden parchment [of
appointment as king] from Bangkok and then received the Hong (Chinese rank
for a tributary king) from Vietnam .... In those cases, in correspondence
with [Siam), they used the Thai titles; in correspondence with Vietnam, they
used the Vietnamese titles. Vietnam and Siam are hostile to each other, hence
separate appointments. Each claims Cambodia as their own. On the issue
where both Siam and Vietnam claim Cambodia as their own, France remains
neutral. After the French took control over the south of Vietnam, however,
Cambodia became France's neighbor and a treaty was negotiated for France to
foster Cambodia as Vietnam had previously done. Because [France] was on
good terms with Siam, all amicable relations between Siam and Cambodia
remain. [Both France and Siam] have equal power over Cambodia .... What

Sovereignty

93

the French consul said was in accordance with the agreement made with you at
Udong (the 1863 treaty) .... After the consul's briefing, the senior ministers
have discussed the matter among themselves and have decided unanimously to
depute Phraya Montrisuriyawong to bestow on you the golden parchment and
insignia as your coronation. 45
Whether or not this statement conveyed Aubaret's words correctly is not
the issue; the question is how Mongkut and his ministers understood the situation. In another essay on the Cambodian question, Mongkut tells us that
at first Siam did not quite understand the French agreement with the Cambodian king. He then details the situation in the indigenous discourse: Cambodia still submitted to both Siam and France. Unlike Vietnam, Siam and
France were friends. Thus Siam agreed to let France take care of the Cambodian rulers and two parts of the realm which were too far away for Siam to
look after, while Siam still looked after the other two parts which were close
to Siam. Hence the Cambodian rulers should still pay respect to both Siam
46
and France. By showing that France took the place of Vietnam in the existing relationship and by allowing the two important rituals of submissionnamely the tribute payment and Bangkok's role in the crowning of a tributary king-to be practiced, the French role was not alien to the indigenous
polity. France became a new partner of the old mutual patronage over Cambodia. It seems that the French had deliberately exploited the indigenous tributary relationship.
But in this new partnership, the victim was not only Cambodia nor was
the victor merely France. Another contest, quietly gathering strength, was
the mode of relationship among the countries concerned. On the one hand,
the mutual protection over Cambodia provided an excellent guarantee of
peace and normal life in Cambodia, as a Cambodian king once said. It had
been a condition of stability in the region. This multiple sovereignty was not
unusual and needed no adjustment, unless a new struggle for supremacy
broke out. On the other hand, however, the recruitment of the French into
this partnership provided an opportunity for the European mode of colonial
relations to be realized. In this mode, it was unusual for a country to have
multiple, overlaying sovereignties. This situation guaranteed neither peace
nor stability. Adjustment was inevitable.
Both conceptually and practically, two modes of interstate relations were
playing in the same field, making relations among these states ambiguous. To
resolve the ambiguity of sovereignty over Cambodia, France appealed in subsequent years to the international community in terms of international law.
Mongkut similarly asserted Siam's claim to the world community, but he
based his claim on the indigenous polity. In his discourse he presented a Thai

94

Chapter Four

version of Cambodian history showing the status of Cambodia (a half-civilized half-barbarian people as he said) as a tributary to the more civilized race
of Siam. 47 Within a few years France had repeatedly urged the Siamese court
to negotiate the "Cambodian political question." Eventually, on 15 July
1867 the Siamese envoy to Paris signed the treaty recognizing France as having s~le authority over Cambodia. The multiple submission for Cambodia's
survival had become an opportunity for the French, the agency of the new
geography. The premodern polity with its conception _and practice ~f territory and sovereignty became the loser. The modern pohty was estabhshed as
the new legitimate mode of interstate relations, not only for the Westerners
but also for the indigenous elite.
On the southern frontier of Siam, both Siam and Britain increased their
interference and control over the Malay states in one way or another
throughout the last three decades of the nineteenth century by establishing
their commissioners in the states in which they had influence. Both guarded
their own influence without clashes. By that time the colonialists in British
politics had proposed the annexation of the Malay states and the Kra isthmus,
though the opposition wishing to avoid any provocation of the French was
also strong. The British began establishing full control over the Malay states
after a series of conflicts among the Malay rulers broke out in the 1860s and
1870s. Siam, on the other hand, gradually integrated the states it claimed into
the new centralized administration. Kedah in particular became a province
under direct control of Bangkok in 1871; in 1891 it was upgraded to become
a regional center in the new administrative system. 48 Yet Siam :aced many
difficulties in controlling, let alone integrating, the Malay provmces. They
became Siam's burden. Finally, Siam gave four Malay states, Kedah included,
to Britain in 1909 in exchange for some benefits, such as the British concession on its extraterritoriality in Siam, and a low interest loan to construct
railways between Bangkok and British Malaya. 49 The formal negotiations for
boundary demarcation started at this time.
.
Likewise, the boundary demarcation between Siam and Cambodta under
the French Empire started once the political agreement about the sovereignty
of Cambodia in the modern sense had been resolved. 50 But when Siam and
French Cochin China tried to delimit their territorial boundaries in the areas
along the Mekhong, problems emerged because the areas forming the buffer
between them were full of multiply sovereigned towns. It had yet to be
decided to which country they belonged.

THE DISPUTE BETWEEN Siam and France over the Lao region in the decades
around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has been widely
investigated by scholars of Southeast Asia. The issue has been studied basically in only three ways. The first is the perspective of international relations:
the diplomatic relations between Siam, France, Britain, and certain other
European powers such as Russia and Germany. Studies in this vein have
looked at colonialist policies, actions, negotiations, treaties, Siam's foreign
policy, and effects of the treaties. The second approach is to look at the
domestic politics of the countries involved: the factional disputes within the
court or government and the biographies of key figures, Siam's ability to deal
with the imperialists in such matters as domestic affairs, the armed forces,
administration, and major social changes to counter the imperialist threat.
The third approach has been to describe the events: clashes, disputes, heroic
episodes, and the French naval blockade of the Chao Phraya River at the
Grand Palace in Bangkok in 1893.
Despite the different angles, most studies of the Franco-Siamese dispute
have dealt with the same theme: the aggression of French imperialism. The
Siamese rulers have been praised for their diplomatic genius, their skill and
farsightedness in handling the situation, and their incomparable statesmanship in domestic affairs. It seems beyond doubt, according to these studies,
that the incident was a result of the aggression of the French imperialists.
Although the dispute itself was about territories, very little attention has
been paid to the most critical factor: the nature of space itself.
The reason may have something to do with the nature of the evidence,
mostly the correspondence between Bangkok, Paris, and London. Hence the
historical concern has been to discover how these territories were divided
politically rather than the transforming nature of space. Diplomacy and bat-

95

tles occupy the attention of most descriptions. The more fundamental reason,
however, is that scholars have presumed that there was no difference in the
knowledge and technology of political space. The preoccupation with modern ideas of sovereignty, the integrity of a state, and international relations is
so overwhelming that it leads us to overlook-perhaps even to preclude
beforehand-the existence of other conceptions and practices apart from our
own. With such a preoccupation, scholars usually try to unravel the sole
legitimate sovereignty over the disputed territories by weighing the historical
rights of the disputants. The grid of the modern mind renders the unfamiliarity of the indigenous polity and geography more familiar to us by translating
them into modern discourse. Such scholars fail to recognize the rapidly
increasing role of the new technology of space. Consequently, these studies
mislead us into considering only the point of view of those states which
became modern nations. Whenever the issue is raised, we hear only the
claims of the major nations. The fate of the tiny tributaries under dispute
remains virtually unknown. Their voices have not been heard. It is as if they
occupied a dead space with no life, no view, no voice, and thus no history of
their own.
The situation of multiple sovereignty was common for the smaller kingdoms and tiny chiefdoms on all the frontiers of Siam except that between
Siam and Burma, including the whole Lao region along the Mekhong River
and beyond. Remarkably, a muang in this situation was called in Thai and
Lao by the adjective songfaifa or samfaifa, literally "under two overlords" or
"under three overlords" respectively, with the first word song (two) and sam
(three) indicating the number of overlords to which such a muang submitted.1 Sometimes it was called suaisongfai(fa) or suaisamfai(fa). The word suai
means tribute and the final word was sometimes omitted, hence meaning
tribute to two and three overlords respectively. 2
The comparatively smaller kingdoms such as Lanna, Luang Phrabang, and
Vientiane were always under many overlords at one time. All of the tiny
chiefdoms between Lanna and the Burmese kingdoms, between Luang Phrabang, Yunnan, Tonkin, and between Vientiane and Tonkin or Annam, were
also the muang of many overlords. They were chiefdoms of the Shan, Lu,
Karen, Lao, Phuan, Phuthai, Chinese, and several other ethnic peoples. They
were weaker, more fragmented, yet autonomous in their relations to the
powerful ones. Consequently, they paid submission to any superior who
could provide protection or inflict wounds upon them.
These tiny tributaries were regarded as the frontier of several kingdoms
simultaneously. In other words, the realms of the supreme overlords-Siam,
Burma, and Vietnam-were overlapping. This situation was indeed the root

Margin

97

of troubles when the notion of a modern boundary with absolute and exclusive territorial sovereignty was applied, since the margins of the major states
in the region were ambiguous.
By the closing decades of the nineteenth century the regime in Bangkok
was well aware of the problem. It voluntarily entered the contest for the
ambiguously sovereign space. The British and French, however, worked
their way through from the west and the east at the same time. Carrying different flags, all of them were agents of modern geography to displace the
indigenous premodern political space. Their only disagreement was over how
to settle the overlapping frontiers. This desire for exclusive territorial sovereignty led to the Franco-Siamese crisis in 1893.

Overlapping Margins
In the north ~f Siam, Lanna and Sipsong Panna (in southern China today)
were two regwnal powers. Lanna, with its center at Chiangmai, was one of
the most powerful kingdoms in the region in the fourteenth to early sixteenth centuries. During the late sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, it became
a tributary of the Burmese Toungoo kingdom and occasionally of Siam as
well. In the late eighteenth century, after being devastated by the protracted
war between Siam and Burma during the 1760s to 1780s, it was restored as a
tributary of Siam. In the north of Lanna, Sipsong Panna was a cluster of more
fragmented and smaller states, of which Kengtung (Chiang Tung) was the
most powerful. Lying between Burma, Lanna, and Yunnan, Kengtung was a
tributary of both the Burmese and Chinese overlords, and sometimes of
Siam, while it had its own tributaries in the sphere of Sipsong Panna.
Between Chiangmai and Kengtung, there were numerous weaker chiefdoms such as Jenghung (Chiang Rung), Chiang Khaeng, and Chiang Saen,
which paid tribute to all local overlords as well as directly to the Burmese and
sometimes Siamese supreme overlords. Yet they were autonomous to the
extent that they often defied the overlords and changed allegiance. Nonetheless, any dispute within their courts or between their overlords would always
lead to interference by more overlords. 3
The status and situation of a chiefdom under many overlords was quite
common and recognized by the overlords. Chiang Saen-an ancient town
under the overlordship of Chiangmai, Kengtung, and Luang Phrabang
throughout its history-was depopulated and abandoned in the late eighteenth century during the wars between Burma and Siam and was not
restored until the 1880s. By that time, however, it was occupied by Shan
people who earned their living around the fortress of the abandoned town.

98

Chapter Five

Remarkably, while reasserting Siam's sovereignty over Chiang Saen, Chulalongkorn (Rama V) did not claim that it belonged to Siam exclusively. He
suggested that Chiangmai should allow the Shan to settle there if Burma and
Kengtung allowed Chiang Saen to submit to both sides (Burma/Kengtung
versus Siam/Chiangmai). Unsurprisingly, the Burmese view on this issue, as
reported by Chulalongkorn in the same letter, was not a claim to Chiang
Saen but a request for the status quo of Chiang Saen-that is, to leave it as a
"common" muang where people of both Kengtung and Chiangmai were
allowed to live. 4
Along the Salween River on the western frontier of Lanna was the territory of Kayah people, also known as the Red Karen or Yang. As Ronald
Renard has pointed out, the tiny Kayah states formed a dynamic, fluctuating
frontier between Burma and Lanna because they gave allegiance to both sides
and had defied the authorities of both from time to time since the late seventeenth century. Sometimes the Kayah even demanded tribute from tiny
towns under Chiangmai's power. 5
The Lao region along the Mekhong River was full of chiefdoms in a similar situation. Like Cambodia and Lanna, the Lao state of Lan Sang was
among the powerful regional kingdoms, but it became a tributary of Siam
and Burma from the late sixteenth century onward. In the 1680s Lan Sang
split into two separate kingdoms, Luang Phrabang and Vientiane. And in the
eighteenth century another overlord, Vietnam, became involved. From the
end of the eighteenth century, both of the Lao centers paid tribute to Siam
and Vietnam regularly. In 1826 Prince Anuwong of Vientiane led a revolt of
the tributary against its oppressive overlord, Siam. Its failure led to the direct
involvement of Vietnam since the prince requested Annam's protection. The
entire Mekhong region was contested from then on.
Between Luang Phrabang, Vientiane, and the Vietnamese centers of
Tonkin and Annam, there were numerous tiny chiefdoms similar to those in
the north of Lanna. The upper part of the area adjacent to southern China
was known as Sipsong Chuthai, a cluster of tiny chiefdoms within the sphere
of Lai's influence. Lai was an ancient settlement of Phuthai people. It paid
tribute to Luang Phrabang, Tonkin, and China (Canton). As its own history
tells us, it had been under three overlords for more than three hundred years. 6
It divided its realm into three parts, each of whose manpower and levies were
to be paid to each overlord. Its court, administrative pattern, currency, and
alphabet followed the Chinese and Vietnamese traditions. Its ruler was
known as K wan Fu to Vietnam, as Hong to China, and as Luang
Phromwongsa to Luang Phrabang. 7 Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century, a large number of Chinese bandits known to local people as

Margin

99

the Ho, fleeing from southern China after the failed Taiping rebellion (18501864), had troubled the region. The Tonkinese force protected Lai and helped
it to drive the Ho away, while Lai's request for protection from Luang Phrabang was put aside. The tribute to Luang Phrabang was thus suspended. In
the immediate period before the Franco-Siamese dispute, therefore, Lai was
predominantly under the influence of Vietnam both culturally and militarily. 8
Thaeng, or Dien Bien Phu as we know it today, was a samfaifa of Lai,
Vietnam, and Luang Phrabang. The ties among them were so strong that not
only was Thaeng a long-time tributary of the three overlords, but in the
myth of its origin Thaeng was also believed to have a common origin in this
world with the Vietnamese and the Lao. Their ancestors were brothers. 9 If
the relationship between Thaeng and Vietnam was especially close, Siam's
involvement with Thaeng was virtually nonexistent. Yet just before the
Franco-Siamese dispute Thaeng was conquered by Siam and became the outermost town where the Siamese established headquarters for their campaigns
against the Ho in 1885. 10 It was just at this time that Siam arrested Thaeng's
ruler, who was a son of Lai's ruler, because he refused to submit to Siam's
force, and replaced him with a new figure loyal to Siam.
South of Sipsong Chuthai was another cluster of tiny towns called
Huaphan Thangha Thanghok (hereafter Huaphan). All of them were tributaries of Luang Phrabang, Vientiane, Tonkin, Annam, and sometimes the
southern Chinese rulers. After the ill-fated revolt of Anuwong in 1826,
Huaphan was handed over by Siam to Luang Phrabang as a reward for Luang
Phrabang's loyalty. But at the same time Huaphan was given as a gift from
Anuwong to Vietnam for the latter's protection against Siam. Faced with the
Ho bandits, Huaphan requested help from both Vietnam and Siam. Consequently, in 1885 the Siamese forces declared the whole cluster to be Siam's.
The case of Phuan was similar. After the Anuwong revolt, it was handed
over to Luang Phrabang and Vietnam at the same time. Anuwong himself
fled after his defeat and resided in Phuan until the Siamese troops came to
uproot him. Siam imposed its loyalist as ruler, though he was executed a few
years later by Vietnam. As a consequence, in 1833 Siam launched a campaign
of destroying and depopulating Huaphan and Phuan because they were
regarded as front-line towns of Vietnam. 11 After the fourteen-year VietnamSiamese war, Vietnam restored Phuan's ruler as its tributary and required him
to pay tribute to Vietnam annually. Nevertheless, Phuan fell into Siam's
hands again in 1885 by the same force which subdued Thaeng, Lai, and
Huaphan. 12
The areas along the Mekhong were full of tiny tributary states. Even
though the rulers of these chiefdoms considered themselves as sovereign and

100

Chapter Five

autonomous in their own right, they were on the margins of many spheres of
overlords' power. In other words, they were frontier towns from the perspective of the overlords-either their own frontier or that of the enemy. As
frontier towns, they were left more or less independent and neglected, so
long as there was no war between the overlords of the region. But in a war
situation, any tributaries en route between the rivals would become the first
victims. Under more lenient circumstances, a local ruler might be forced to
submit himself to the force of the overlord; otherwise, he would be replaced
by a loyalist of that overlord. In the worst case, either they would be forced
to supply food and manpower, or they would be plundered, destroyed, and
depopulated, in order to deprive the enemy of supplies. As a Siamese commander put it in the case ofPhuan in 1833:
Be careful not to let any Phuan people return to their home town. In the dry
season, keep trying to remove those Phuan who are still in the town. If they
are cooperative, convince them; if after persuasion alone there are any Phuan
left, the king proposes to use force to move them completely. Don't leave any
potential food supply for the enemy. 13

By all these methods, the tiny tributaries regarded as frontier muang were
forced to change allegiance from time to time for their survival. The sovereignty of these states was therefore ambiguous and complicated by the shifts
of allegiance and the reverses following conquests. But an occupation was
always temporary, and the aim of a takeover was in fact to compel a tributary
ruler to submit his allegiance, which by no means guaranteed the conqueror's
exclusive possession. Despite the conqueror's claim, these "frontier" tributaries were still multiply sovereign.
In the indigenous polity in which the power field of a supreme overlord
radiated like a candle's light, these tiny chiefdoms were always located in the
overlapping arena of the power fields. 14 Unlike the border between Siam and
Burma which kept both sides apart, all other borders of Siam were shared by
others. Their frontiers were overlapping. In the indigenous interstate relations, the overlapping margin of two power fields was not necessarily considered a problem unless it served as a bridge for the enemy to invade. Multiple
sovereignty was well recognized by the parties involved as the status quo.
Even Chulalongkorn and his Burmese counterpart preferred leaving Chiang
Saen under both overlords. 15 Thus the ambiguous sovereignty of these frontier tributaries was useful and desired by the overlords. Instead of establishing
an independent state as a buffer zone, in this indigenous practice the overlords shared sovereignty over the buffer zones as long as the rulers of the
frontier tributaries were loyal to all relevant overlords. Not only had Siam

Margin

101

never been bounded by the modern kind of boundary but it was also surrounded by "common" frontiers, the shared borders.
For modern polities, however, the overlapping frontier is not permissible.
The division of territorial sovereignty between states must be clear-cut at the
point where both power fields interface. They must not overlap, and there
must be no distance between them. To transform a premodern margin to a
modern territorial interface, or to create a modern edge of a state out of a premodern shared space, there could be more than one possible boundary, and all
of them would be equally justified because the boundary could be anywhere
within the overlapping arena, depending on how the sovereignty of a tributary was decided. Mathematically speaking, the more tributaries and more
overlords involved, the greater the number of possible boundaries. Accordingly, the possibility of disputes over territories is infinite.
Nonetheless, to fulfill the desire to have the boundary fixed and sovereignty exclusive, the tributaries in the overlapping frontiers must be determined and allocated. This was done by both Siam and the European powers.
Siam operated in its own way to extract its own share of the territories to be
allocated. Siam was not a helpless victim of colonialism as is generally
thought. The Siamese ruling circle at the close of the nineteenth century was
familiar with the tributary relationship, and many of the elite became familiar
with the Western political geographical concept as well. It was in the wake
of col~nialism, armed with the force of the new kind of boundary and polity,
that S1am urgently needed to secure its overlordship over its tributaries. On
the one hand, the Siamese rulers were aware of the uncertain sovereignty of
these tributaries in that they did not yet really belong to Siam. On the other
hand, Siam wished to expand and enforce a stronger grip over the tributaries.
The difference from previous overlord protection was that this time Siam was
equipped with a new mechanism of overlordship in terms of force, administration, and boundary demarcation and mapping. Siam entered the contest
with the European powers to conquer and incorporate these marginal states
into its exclusive sovereign territory. This expansionist desire was expressed
overtly and straightforwardly.

The Making of "Our" Space
In the late nineteenth century, Siam was aware of the presence of the more
powerful Europeans. But this did not mean its desire to expand its overlordship over any possible tributary had ended. When Burma was in trouble with
the British in 1885, some Shan towns requested Siamese protection. The king
responded with an ambitious remark: "The Thai, the Lao, and the Shan all

102

Chapter Five

consider themselves peoples of the same race. They all respect me as their
supreme sovereign, the protector of their well-being." 16
The king had a very clear understanding that Luang Phrabang, a major Lao
tributary, had been a songfaifa to Vietnam and Siam, and its allegiance to
Siam was not without doubt. In the period of the Ho disturbance, Bangkok's
troops did not provide adequate protection. Luang Phrabang was sacked in
1887, and the king was able to escape only with the help of a French contingent. Although the Bangkok force recovered it in 1888, Chulalongkorn was
worried about its loyalty. He feared that the Lao court would be tempted by
the French. In his secret letter to the resident commissioner to Luang Phrabang newly appointed by Bangkok, his instructions included details of how
to please the Lao rulers, how to make them suspicious of the French, and
how to argue against the French. But the most interesting remark was his
conscious strategy to turn the ambiguity of a tributary in Siam's favor:
[We] must try to please [Luang Phrabang] by describing the fact that the Thai
and Lao belong to the same soil. ... France is merely an alien who looks
down on the Lao race as savage. Whatever the French do to please the rulers of
Luang Phrabang is merely bait on a hook .... Although the Lao people habitually regard Lao as We and Thai as They when only the two peoples are considered, comparing the Thai and the French, however, it would be natural that
they regard the Thai as We and the French as They. 17

This was a fundamental aim of the two major efforts which have been known
to historians of Siam as measures of self-defense against the European threatnamely the reform of provincial administration and the expeditions to suppress the Ho disturbances in the Lao region. Both were in fact operations to
resolve the ambiguity of the overlapping margins.
The reform of provincial administration in Siam in the 1880s and 1890s is a
favorite subject for those interested in the modernization of Siam. Reform
was first tested in the 1870s in Lanna and then developed and applied to the
Lao region along the Mekhong, including Luang Phrabang and many other
large and small tributaries. Finally, from 1892 onward it was implemented in
other regions including the inner provinces of Siam. It was a gradual process
of displacing the traditional local autonomy, especially in these tributaries, by
the modern mechanism of centralization. The tempo, tactics, problems, and
solutions varied from place to place. But the final outcomes were the same:
the control of revenue, taxes, budgets, education, the judicial system, and
other administrative functions by Bangkok through the residency. The residents, most of whom were the king's brothers or close associates, were sent
to supervise local rulers or even to take charge of the governorship of each

Margin

103

locality. It should be remarked that while the relationship between Bangkok
and its tributaries was hierarchical and operated through rulers, the new
administration was called the thesaphiban system, literally meaning protection
over territory.
The new administrative methods were very much like the regimes established in a colonial country. Mongkut himself once wished to go to Singapore
to learn Western styles of government. Chulalongkorn fulfilled his father's
wish from the early years of his reign by going to Singapore, Java, and India
where the Thai rulers believed that the government was similar to Europe's
and just as civilized. 18 In Chulalongkorn 's words to the viceroy of India at
that time: "Both I and the council are convinced that there is no country in
the East where the science of government is so well understood or the welfare of the people so faithfully attended to [as India]." 19 Thus it is not surprising that the new administration was in many respects similar to what a colonial regime conceived for native people. Prince Damrong, the craftsman of
this new system, in his writing about the regime in Java, referred to the
Dutch residents as "Retsiden (Samuhathesaphiban)." 20 Here he likened the colonial residency to the Thai governorship of the reformed system, putting the
latter in parentheses to give his readers the meaning of the former. One
should not fail to read the other way round-the term outside the parentheses is in fact the definition of Samuhathesaphiban-and to note how similar the
two systems were in Damrong's view.
If the reform eradicated the ambiguity of space in a comparatively peaceful
manner, the expeditions against the Ho disturbance were more violent. The
Ho was the word the Lao used for the Yunnanese in general. In this case it
was for the Chinese who had been defeated in the Taiping revolt in southern
China in the mid-1860s and then fled southward into the upper Mekhong
valley and the Black River valley. They became independent armed bands
who plundered, destroyed, or occupied the tiny chiefdoms and even threatened the Lao kingdoms along the Mekhong during the 1870s and 1880s. In
1884-1885 and 1885-1887 Siam sent two expeditions to fight them. 21 But
the situation became much more complicated by the infighting among the
local tiny chiefdoms themselves.
On many occasions the Ho were merely a mercenary force helping one
chief to attack another. In some circumstances they collaborated with a local
chief to fight another alliance of Ho and local chief. The forces of the Ho and
those of local chiefdoms became mingled. Many Ho Leaders became rulers
and officials of local chiefdoms, and in turn many local chieftains were
regarded by Siam as leaders of the Ho bandits. The understanding that disturbances arose because of bandits from outside the region was partly true. But

104

Chapter Five

to lay the blame for all the disturbances on the Ho was definitely misleading.
The sack of Luang Phrabang in 1887, for example, was in fact the retaliation
by the chief of Lai for the arrest of his three sons by the Siamese force in
1886. 22 Yet it is true that Lai's force did contain some Ho bandits. The ruler
of Lai was therefore regarded by Siam at that time, as well as by historians, as
a chief of the Ho gangs. 23
The Siamese forces against the Ho disturbances in the 1880s did not merely
aim at suppressing the Ho; they also intended to reassert Siam's suzerainty
over that region by force. Moreover, it was no longer the premodern exercise
of overlordship. In the words of Surasakmontri, the field commander, the
aim of his troops was to suppress the Ho as well as to "settle the anakhet":
It is an opportunity to settle the anakhet. Because France has waged wars with
[Vietnam] and is going to demarcate the boundary close to Huaphan and Sipsong Chuthai, it may move forward to set foot on His Majesty's realm claiming that they have been Vietnam's territories. For this reason, and to avoid losing an opportunity, His Majesty gave us the order to mobilize the troops in
order to quash the Ho in the dry season this year of the cock. 24
The phrase "settle the anakhet" indicates that there was a problem about the
frontier, boundary, or limit of the realm to be solved. The mission was to
seize the opportunity to make it clear that these areas belonged to Siam exclusively. Chulalongkorn himself advised at length on the boundary issue and
how to deal with the French in anticipation that a confrontation could take
place: "Whichever side of the border belongs to whom, let each side make a
map in order to negotiate and divide [the territories] by cordial agreement in
Bangkok." 25
After the fourteen-year war between Siam and Vietnam during 18341848, the tributaries in the region returned to their status quo as tributaries
of Luang Phrabang and Vietnam. The campaign against the Ho from 1884
onward was the first presence of Siam's power over these tributaries. Siam
correctly claimed that they belonged to Luang Phrabang. Despite such a
claim, Siam recognized the multiple overlordship over these tributaries, even
for Luang Phrabang itself. To claim exclusive sovereignty over them meant
to expand the realm of Siam under the regime of the new geographical concept over the indigenous ambiguous space. In other words, after conquering
these tiny chiefdoms, Siam had to introduce the means to secure its exclusive
power, instead of allowing local chiefs to pay tribute to several overlords as
they had done before.
Several incidents showed that Siam was quite conscious of its expansionist
action. In 1886 when the troops seized a town definitely outside Siam's

Margin

105

sphere of power, for example, the king advised the troops to retain the town.
If the French raised the issue later, he further advised, an alibi should be given
both in the field and in Bangkok that it was a songfaifa, or that the ruler of
the town had requested Siam's intervention, or that the Siamese force had followed the Ho, the common enemy of Siam and France, and had occupied the
town to pacify it, not to invade it. 26 Likewise, when the troops marched into
Sipsong Chuthai in 1887, Surasakmontri asked whether he should incorporate them into the Siamese realm. The king, in consultation with his foreign
affairs secretary, advised Surasakmontri to annex them: "If the French argued
or requested [the return of Sipsong Chuthai], and if it should be relinquished,
do so later." 27 The premodern polity did not confuse the Siamese rulers. On
the contrary, they exploited it to take over former tributaries. "Peace" and
"the Ho" were merely positive and negative tokens to justify their action.
Another important case which must be mentioned is Khamkoet and
Khammuan. These were twin towns in the sphere of the Phuan where, in
1893, a collision between the Siamese and the French forces took place. In
1886, Chulalongkorn overtly advised an opportunistic policy on this twin
township:
In the case of Khamkoet and Khammuan, (we] are more disadvantaged ...
because it is evident that [Vietnam] had appointed the rulers. However, there is
our claim that it belonged to two overlords. Now France controls [Vietnam]
but not yet completely so; thus it may not yet be ready to administer the distant towns. If it is possible to make Khamkoet and Khammuan ours by whatever means, contemplate on this and do it. If it is too ambitious or it will cause
a dispute with France, don't try; [we] do not lose anything apart from the fact
that our boundary would not be on the mountain ranges. 2s
In 1891, Phra Yod, the first ethnic Thai ruler of Phuan and a historical hero
in the Franco-Siamese conflict, recommended that Siam should retain the
t:Vin towns not by any historical right but for the security of Siam's occupatiOn of the Mekhong region. 29
Previously, a conquest would require a submission and, in most cases, temporary exclusive control over the town. The ruler of that town might submit
to another overlord to ensure survival after the military presence had
departed. But in the conquest in the 1880s the Siamese forces were to be there
permanently. The presence of overlord "protection" was no longer remote.
The Siamese forces transformed the regime of each small state they conquered. In some cases, previous rulers were replaced by figures loyal to Siam.
In many others, Thai officials were appointed to govern these towns. Wherever local rulers were allowed to rule their towns, Thai officials were

106

Chapter Five

appointed as supervisors. All new local regimes were directly administered by
military commanders from Bangkok. The ambiguous space in the remote
Mekhong region was determined by military means. To put it another way,
military force concretized these parts of Siam's geo-body.
The new administration was a mechanism to establish a new relationship
between Bangkok and its former tributaries, hence a new kind of sovereignty
within a new entity. The military operation was nothing but territorial conquest. Both operations established a new kind of political geography in which
neither overlapping margin nor multiple sovereignty was permitted. The
earth's surface was inscribed in a new way. How important the geographical
mission was in the minds of the Siamese elite in the so-called suppression of
the Ho is best indicated by the titles conferred on local rulers who submitted
themselves to the Siamese forces. Traditionally, titles tended to signify
power, merit, blessing, relations to deities or sacred objects, and other magical qualities. This time the titles were weird and had never appeared anywhere before: Phra Sawamiphaksayamkhet ("loyalty to the Siamese khet"),
Phiaphan Thura-anakhetkosai ("concerning the business of the anakhet"),
Phra Phithak-anakhet ("protector of the anakhet"), Phraya Khumphonphithak-buranakhet ("the commander protecting territorial integrity"),
Phra Ratana-anakhet ("the bejewelled anakhet"), and Phraya Khanthasema
("the boundaries, domain of kingdom"), for example. 30
Nonetheless, the local chiefs might not understand the conquest in any
terms other than the tributary practice they had known. They might not
anticipate that this time the conquest was a new kind of political control, a
practice of the new geographical consciousness. The actions taken together
constituted a code which signified two kinds of relationship simultaneously.
On the one hand, it signified the premodern overlord/tributary relationship.
On the other, it represented the new polity and political geography. The shift
occurred inevitably once the agent of the new discourse conquered the indigenous one. That is to say, in an action very much like the exercise of an overlord's power, the new conception and practice began to realize the new discourse in concrete terms. As France had stepped into the indigenous tributary
relationship by establishing a double-coding protectorate over Cambodia, its
action could be understood by the Cambodian and Thai courts as an indigenous overlordship. By a similar strategy, Bangkok imposed a new kind of
relationship, sovereignty, and space through colonizing actions, that is,
the conquest and reformed administration. The colonial-style relationship
bridged the transition in the displacement process. It was a relationship
between a superior power and its conquered states, yet it was unlike the trib-

r

Margin

107

utaryI overlord relationship in that the ambiguity of sovereignty and space
had been resolved.
Certainly, Bangkok never thought of itself as similar to the European
imperialists. The most significant distinction in Siam's view was probably
that the French and other European powers were alien or foreigners or
"They," but Siam was "We" to native peoples in the region. If the word
"colonization" is too harsh here, it seems that there were two types of conquest: one by "We," the other by "They." Undoubtedly, this is a powerful
distinction which makes the conquests by "We" perhaps more legitimate
and worthy of celebration while the other type deserves condemnation. Of
course, Lai, Thaeng, or even Luang Phrabang might not consider Siam as
much "We" as "They."

New Margins: Siam and the British
Siam did not alone resolve the issue of ambiguous territories. Around the
same time as the reform was under way and the Siamese forces were marching through the Mekhong region, the European powers moved to take part
in the settlement of the ambiguous territories. In a sense, all of them were
working alongside one another to displace the indigenous political space.
Confrontations thus occurred not only among these human powers, but also
between different realms of geographical knowledge.
After the final Anglo-Burmese war was over in 1885, the frontier between
Lanna and Upper Burma became a problem as the region was within the
spheres of several powers. Two major areas in question were the Kayah state
along the Salween River and the chiefdoms of the Shan and the Lu people
between Kengtung and Lanna. 31 As for the frontier along the Salween, small
villages with the Siamese white elephant flags and posts with stockades and
garrisons were established along the border. Some Kayah were tattooed to
substantiate Siam's claim for five Kayah towns. 32 In 1875, however, the Burmese king at Ava had put forward a claim to the British government in India
that the Kayah chiefs had sent "virgins to the Burman king as tokens of subjection" and this customary present had been given to Burma "since the
beginning of the world." The Kayah people, a Burmese envoy said, "had
taken the oath of allegiance to Burma from the earliest times to within the
last few months." 33 The British thus supported local rulers who rejected
Siam's claim. Then, in late 1888, the British force "resumed possession."
Siam protested. 34
In the territory between Kengtung and Chiangmai, there were several dis-

108

Chapter Five

putable issues. Siam and the British decided to settle the problem by setting
up a commission to interrogate local people and survey the areas. The most
controversial issue was the case of Muang Sing: did it belong to Kengtung,
then under the British, or to Nan of Siam? The chief of Muang Sing was a
relative of Kengtung's ruler. But he submitted to Nan· and paid the gold and
silver trees to Bangkok as well. When the dispute occurred, he even offered
the same tribute to the British to express his desire for British suzerainty. 35
The inquiry and negotiation were carried out throughout 1891-1892.
Finally they reached an agreement in 1892 to give Muang Sing to Siam and
the five Kayah towns with the rich forest to British Burma. 36 The survey,
mapping, and demarcation had been done concurrently with the negotiations
during 1890-1891. The final delimitation was done by a joint commission
during 1892-1893. The agreement with maps was formally ratified in 1894.
The fact that these disputes did not lead to a violent conflict was owing to
many factors. Basically, the British India government wanted to leave Siam as
a buffer state on the eastern front of India. Around that time, furthermore,
France increased its activity in Indochina, and its conflicts with Siam intensified. Any outbreak of aggression between Siam and the British might provoke the French on the other sideY On the other hand, it seems that Siam's
attitude toward Britain at that time was a mixture of fear, respect, reverence,
and desire for friendship and some kind of alliance. This was quite opposite to
Siam's attitude toward the French, which was rather hostile.
The influence of the British in the Siamese ruling circle was considerable.
Among the most important signs of this influence was the role of the British
in the crisis in 1874 when a civil war nearly broke out because of a factional
dispute within the Bangkok court. The dispute was settled by a British arbitrator. 38 Another sign of the special relationship was Siamese-British relations
in the conflict with the French. Siam had high hopes that Britain would help.
The Siamese rulers informed the British at every stage of the conflict and consulted the British on every move they took. 39 Siam even requested a British
"protectorate of a modified kind." But Britain refused to take any action
against the French in order to avoid provoking a reaction. On the contrary,
Siam was advised to surrender and concede the left bank of the Mekhong as
the French demanded. 40
There were other signs of Siam's special relationship with the British, as
well, such as the roles of British advisors in the Siamese regime. A recent
study of the formation of the Thai state even suggests that the so-called
administrative reform in Lanna was in fact the result of the cooperation
between Bangkok and the British for the benefit of the forest industry. The
new state mechanism was designed to facilitate British interests, not as a

r

Margin

109

defense strategy against the British threat. 41 All this may remind us of relations between Kedah and British Penang and the indigenous politics of protection through alliance with one superior power against another. Therefore
it was not surprising at all that Siam and the British government finally concluded a treaty in 1892 in a peaceful fashion about all matters pertaining to
the undecided tributaries. Siam hoped, however, that the agreement would
induce the British to intervene in the dispute between Siam and France at that
time. Siam also hoped that the agreement would guarantee that Siam would
receive assistance and that there would be no arms embargo through their
common borders. 42 Like Kedah, such an expectation was a grand illusion.

The Making of Interface by Force
Unlike the British-Siamese differences, the dispute between Siam and France
to settle the ambiguous space along the Mekhong River was violent. The
French started their campaign to take control over the area about two years
later than Siam. As one historian relates, they found that "small Thai guard
posts appeared all along the watershed .... [The] Thai troops were taking
up positions on the crest of the cordillera, virtually overlooking the plains of
Annam." 43 Therefore the French put forward their counterclaims against
Siam's and against the presence of Siamese forces in the region.
All descriptions and maps done by Europeans in the nineteenth century
identified the areas beyond the Chao Phraya valley as countries separated
from Siam. As Auguste Pavie, the French consul at Luang Phrabang and
Bangkok at the time of conflict and himself a surveyor and explorer,
expressed his view, the realm of Siam was confined to the Chao Phraya valley, but it was not clear to what extent the Lao region was under Siam's sovereignty or at what point Siam touched the Vietnamese sphere. 44 The fact
that Siam had made the first moves and occupied the most territory under
dispute before the French meant that Siam had a slight advantage in terms of
actual possession. The French at the time had to protest strongly against
Siam's presence and the right of possession. Pavie himself referred to the
indigenous practice of multiple submission, arguing that it did not mean
autonomy was lost: Siam had no more rights than China, Annam, or Burma.
He even consulted a chronicle of Luang Phrabang to argue that Siam was
rarely mentioned in Lao history. 45 Ironically, the roles Siam and the French
adopted and the tactics of argument they employed in this particular case
reversed the ones in 1864 when Mongkut protested the French exclusive possession over Cambodia.
One of the turning points of the contest for the Lao region was when

110

Chapter Five

Luang Phrabang was sacked by Lai's force in June 1887 in revenge for Siam's
capture of the sons of Lai's ruler. The king of Luang Phrabang was saved by
Pavie himself. 46 Pavie claimed that after this incident the Lao king had told
him that Luang Phrabang was not a Siamese conquest. It voluntarily offered
tribute to Siam for protection against all attacks. Of course, the king was not
satisfied with the result. Here Pavie reports what the Lao king said in the
indigenous discourse: "I don't want anymore to do with them [Siamese]. If
my son consents, we will offer ourselves as a gift to France, on the condition
that she will keep us away from future misfortunes." 47 Neither of the wouldbe overlords could prevent such a misfortune, however, for they were the
sources of it. Moreover, the Lao king did not realize that in the new geographical discourse which both Siam and France then represented, his discourse of gift giving as a submission without conquest would not be allowed
to exist.
The method that each side used to substantiate its claim and invalidate the
other's-the evidence of submissions-failed to prove anything. All the
counterarguments were equally true and false. The ambiguous margin had to
be decided arbitrarily, either peacefully or violently, because its nature was
logically and historically undecidable. Pavie was right when he remarked that
Siam had to resort to military means because the geographic and ethnographic evidence seemed inadequate to justify its claim. He was also right in
suggesting that the Ho were merely the excuse for Siam to intervene. 48 But
these comments applied equally to the French. As it turned out, the attempt
to eradicate the ambiguity of the border in this region was done by sheer
force on both sides.
Both the Siamese and French forces marched through the areas, raising
their flags over the occupied territories as quickly as possible, until they confronted each other at various points on the left bank of the Mekhong. The
confrontation at Thaeng (Dien Bien Phu) in 1888 was an example of how the
boundary was determined temporarily. In that incident, both forces "suppressed the Ho" along their way until they faced each other at Thaeng. At
first the commanders of both sides claimed their rights and ordered the other
to move out. Finally they agreed to settle the dispute by the simple agreement that neither would move forward. They let the territories belong to the
conqueror until the negotiation in Bangkok resolved the matter through
diplomacy. The agreement at Thaeng in December 1888 applied to all other
fronts throughout the Mekhong region. 49
Not only were tributaries conquered, but the indigenous political geography of multiple sovereign states was also displaced en route. The troops
eliminated the ambiguity. Because of the confrontations, the space under the

r

Margin

111

infantries of both sides was joined for the first time. Spatial overlap was thus
transformed into the interface of two sovereign territories. The power of the
new geographical knowledge exercised by both the Siamese and French forces
prevailed and created a new kind of space. The allotment of territory by military occupation was, however, only tentative and temporary. The geo-body
of both sides had not yet been fixed, because they could not agree in all cases
where the interface should be located.
The Siamese elite by then were concerned for territory-the land about
which their ancestors had never worried and even given away as gifts. The
object over which sovereignty would prevail had shifted from a governed
town and its ruler to an actual territory. For Siam now, every bit of soil was
desirable not so much for its economic value but because of its meaning to
sovereignty, royal dignity, and nationhood. From the first confrontation in
1888 to the 1893 crisis, Siam had exerted great effort to ensure that most of
the borderland would be securely under its sovereignty. Inevitably, the traditional methods of dealing with the borders had to be replaced. Border surveillance became stricter and disciplined. All the localities along the borders were
reinforced. Some no-man's-lands were filled by rotating corvee laborers who
drew lots to camp there temporarily. 50 Of course, all of these practices and
concerns were alien to their predecessors. The battlefield had moved from the
defense of a town's fortress to many other points of collision, including those
wastelands where there was no living body or possession. Many incidents
which led to the Paknam crisis and the blockade of the Chao Phraya River
took place in areas which would have been ignored had the premodern geographical ideas prevailed. The major clash occurred in April 1893 on an
unpopulated sandbar in the middle of the Mekhong.st This led to a regional
and then international crisis in which the French sent two gunboats to blockade the Chao Phraya River. It was just another strategic move to resolve the
ambiguity of space.
The Franco-Siamese dispute has long been considered a conflict of two
nations. But both rivals were actually on the same side as far as the displacement of the indigenous tributary space by a new geo-body is concerned. Both
sides utilized the force of modern knowledge which collided with, and subdued, the indigenous one. The overlapping spheres were determined and distributed. The emerging interface imposed limits on the territory of each side
-a sharp and clear-cut division between the two realms. Moreover, the
domain marked by this new division was transformed into an integral one by
the new mechanism of control. All the actions and incidents were moments
of shifts where the displacement of geographical discourses took place. The
clashes and the blockade can be viewed as moments which led to the emer-

112

Chapter Five

gence of modern territorial sovereignty and international order and a new
meaning of native soil.
But military force and the new administration wer~ not the only D_Ieans to
decide the ambiguity of space. The shift in the embodu~ent of sovereignty to
actual territories implied that the form in which sovereignty was r~p~esented
must shift as well-from traditional rituals and practices of submission t~ a
new representation which dealt directly with hori~ontal planes. The begmning of full-scale surveys and mapping of boundanes by the Chulalongkorn
regime reflected not merely his sympathy for. modern ~eography but. also a
change in the discourse of sovereignty. To fulfill the desi~e to have _their geobodies concretized and their margins defined for exclusive so~ereignty, the
French and the Siamese alike had fought both with force and with maps.

Mapping:
A New Technology of Space

a powerful science inseparable from the knowledge of
the East from the early days of the Europeans' journeys until nineteenth-century colonialism. For the Malay peninsula, the Chinese were the customary
visitors and had made several coastal maps of the area. Some of them became
valuable sources for Europeans such as Marco Polo whose maps were made in
1292-1294. 1 Since then, the map of this region was included in many atlases
of classical, medieval, and early modern Europe. 2 Siam in particular, however, appeared rather late in the European maps of this region. It was not
included in the Portuguese discoveries until the latter half of the sixteenth
century. Thereafter Siam was well recognized by prominent mapmakers. 3
GEOGRAPHY HAD BEEN

Siam in Western Maps
The French and Dutch in the seventeenth century were the leaders in cartographic techniques. The French court, in particular, established a scientific
society led by many generations of cartographers. 4 Both countries were also
among the leading European powers in the Oriental expeditions of the time.
France's close connection with Siam in the 1680s resulted in the advance of
geographical knowledge and the mapping of Siam. The French envoys and
cartographers of the court of Louis XIV published many maps of Siam and
passed their knowledge to other European mapmakers. Figure 7 is the map
drawn by a cartographer traveling with the French envoy to Siam in 1686.
From then on, Siam was prominent on all maps of the region by European
mapmakers. 5
Nonetheless, on all the maps before the second half of the nineteenth century, the detail of Siam was more or less limited to the coastal areas. The interior had been until then terra incognita to the European. Only a few Jesuits

113

114

Chapter Six

and travelers had visited the Lao countries in the mid-seventeenth century. In
1636, a Dutchman had tried to make a map of the river route from the Chao
Phraya in the central plain of what is today Thailand northward to the Lao
countries. It appears that knowledge of the hinterland was quite scant; the
Chao Phraya River on the map was believed to be the route to Lan Sang
(Luang Phrabang or Vientiane) and northward to Liphi, which is in fact on
the Laos-Cambodian border today.
John Crawfurd's mission to Siam in 1821 was partly dedicated to scientific
research on the nature of the land. A geographer himself, he made ten maps
of the eastern coast of the Gulf of Siam including one of the sandbanks and
shoals in the Chao Phraya River's channel from Bangkok to the gulf. 6 Henry
Burney also desired to know about Lanna, which was until then, as he said,
"unknown to European geographers." 7 But he had no opportunity when he
was the British envoy to Bangkok in 1825-1826. Until1830, Crawfurd continued to remark that the description of the northern border of Siam was little better than conjecture. 8 Figure 8 is the map included in his 1828 account
of his missions in 1821-1822 to Siam and Vietnam.
Since Mercator invented the latitude-longitude matrix covering the entire
globe, the world has been full of blank squares waiting to be filled in. The
New World was "discovered." African Africa was found. The unexplored
places were opened up and inscribed on the map. Indeed, modern mapmaking
had inspired innumerable missions to fulfill its desire to plot the entire world.
Like their predecessors in earlier centuries, Crawfurd and many other explorers and colonial authorities of that generation attempted to produce maps of
Siam and the entire region. The desire for geographical knowledge seemed to
be an integral part of colonial expansion since it became a master science for
colonial acquisition as well as for explorers and administrators. 9 Larry Sternstein relates the case of Captain James Low, who produced a map of the relatively unknown region as a way of advancing his career. 10 Realizing that
mainland Southeast Asia was little known but a survey by Crawfurd was
about to yield results, Low hastily produced his map of Siam, Laos, and
Cambodia, a work which was welcomed enthusiastically by several of his
superiors and rewarded with two thousand Spanish dollars. But the map was
drawn from information volunteered by native people without the benefit of
an actual survey. Although Sternstein spends most of his article denouncing
Low's 1824 map, dissecting it in order to show that it was made from outdated data, was ignorant of new findings and indigenous sources, and
"almost entirely based on hearsay,'' 11 Low's maps and his story conveyed the
state of knowledge of the geography of Siam among Europeans at the time,
especially its development in the first half of the nineteenth century.

Mapping

115

The hinterland in the maps of that time was still terra incognita. Sir John
Bowring in his famous books in 1857, for example, believed that there was
an unknown desert between the central plain and Lanna. 12 The course of the
Mekhong River was believed to be straight southeasterly from its headwaters. The great bend, south of Luang Phrabang, which moved eastward
before bending southward again, was unknown until the work of Francis
Garnier was published in 1864. 13 Until then the whole northeastern region of
Thailand today was almost nonexistent, appearing as merely a narrow strip of
land between the Mekhong and a mountain range along the eastern part of
Siam. Siam in European knowledge until the 1850s looked like anything but
an "ancient axe." In fact, an early eighteenth-century description said that its
shape was like a crescent. 14 Obviously these maps were based on information
obtained from native people who did not have a global reference and who
may have had little knowledge of the geography of the hinterland and the
Mekhong.
Despite the variety in the maps, all have a striking similarity. Siam was
located only in the Chao Phraya valley and the upper part of the Malay peninsula. On the northern frontier, Siam extended only a little above Phichai,
Phitsanulok, or Sukhothai, or even south of Kamphaengphet. On the eastern
border, the realm of Siam was limited by a huge mountain range beyond
which lay the realms of Laos and Cambodia. People like Crawfurd and
Bowring acknowledged that the Lao, Cambodian, and Malay regions were
under the fluctuating powers of Siam, Burma, China, and Vietnam. 15 But
clearly, they were thinking of the alternate occupation of these weaker states
by more powerful kingdoms one at a time rather than the simultaneous multiple overlordship without boundaries on the margins. This is not a proof or
disproof of any historical claim. Rather, it is an indication of how they conceived Siam geographically and, probably, what the informants, the local
people, regarded as Siam and not Siam. The maps and accounts may indicate
that in the perception of the Siamese themselves, the Lanna, Lao, and Cambodian regions were not part of Siam.

Western Mapping in Siam
So far there is no evidence on the impact of Dutch and French mapmaking
since the seventeenth century on Siamese mapping. Until the reign of
Mongkut (1851-1868), surveys neither interested nor bothered the Siamese
court except in the case of potential war routes to Bangkok-such as Crawfurd's map of the Chao Phraya channel, which sparked off a protest from the
court. 16 Once a British messenger who wanted to travel by land from

116

Chapter Six

Bangkok to Tenasserim Province was led meandering in the jungle on the
border by a Siamese official to prevent his knowledge of the land route
17
between Bangkok and the British-occupied territories.
Siam under Mongkut's regime was different. The elite were more familiar
with Western ideas and scientific instruments. Globes and maps were among
the instruments enjoyed by the Siamese. How important they were for
Mongkut may be seen from the fact that among the gifts selected by Western
envoys to present to him, maps of many countries and cities were often
included. 18 It is hard to say whether the giver wanted the recipient to have
these maps, with a certain hidden agenda in mind, or the latter desired to
obtain and possess them. It is safe to say that the maps were special enough to
be given to Rex Siamensium, the name Mongkut preferred to call himself in
the correspondence with foreigners. As for the Siamese elite, having witnessed envoys from so many distant countries and having had knowledge
about them for some time, particularly having seen those countries on maps,
could they resist imagining or desiring to have Siam be on a map just as those
civilized countries were? Siam was out there, to be included on the globe.
Yet it was to a considerable extent terra incognita in mapping terms, even to
the Siamese elite. It was there; but it had yet to be fully recognized and
accounted for.
The Siamese elite of Mongkut's regime were more cooperative and ready
to deal with foreigners even with a traditional map. In fact, more than cooperative, the regime was active and creative in expanding the role of mapping
in state affairs. In the last five years of the reign Bangkok issued a large number of letters and instructions asking local authorities about the frontiers on
the Burmese and Cambodian borders. There were also many communications
concerning surveys and mapping of many localities within the realm of Siam
proper such as Phitsanulok, Phimai, and Prachin. Some communications concerned the survey with the French at Sisophon (then on the Thai-Cambodian
border, not inside Cambodia as it is today). 19 Perhaps this was the first sign of
the new concept of territorial administration.
Around the same time, negotiations on many boundaries on both the
western and eastern fronts with the British and French were proceeding. But
there was no evidence that Siam had launched any attempt to draw a map of
its own geo-body. Only in 1866, when he knew that a French exploring
team was surveying the areas along the Mekhong, did Mongkut realize that
Siam must do likewise. A Dutchman was soon appointed to head a team of
surveyors to the Mekhong areas from Nan, Luang Phrabang, then eastward
to Mukdahan. He was among the first Europeans to survey the portion of the
Mekhong north of Luang Phrabang. To date, however, no details about this

Mapping

117

mission in an~ language have been brought to light. 2o Apart from this assignment, there 1s no record of any Siamese survey of its boundary until the
1880s.
Mapping and topographical surveys seemed to play a much greater role in
the modernization projects in Bangkok and certain provincial areas. This role
continued and ~ven. increased in the following reign as Siam moved rapidly
~oward modermz~t10n. The growth of urbanism and construction projects
~n Bangkok, particularly roads, railways, and telegraph lines, required the
mcreasing role of mapping technology in terms of knowledge, technicians
and facilities.
'
. Sin.ce it was a new technology to the Siamese, however, the task of mappmg m those early days was undertaken mostly by foreigners, even by those
who were not technicians. Henry Alabaster, an Englishman who had been
the vice-consul in Bangkok in Mongkut's reign, became one of Chulalongkorn's most trusted advisors. Though he was not a surveyor or cartographer by training, his ability in engineering was adequate. He was responsible
for two major telegraph lines (Bangkok-Paknam and Bangkok-Bangpa-in),
as wel! ~s many roads .in Bangkok and the one from Bangkok to the gulf. His
:ers:~thty very mu~h tmpressed the king, and it was likely that he enjoyed his
JOb. Another foretgner employed by the Bangkok regime in 1878-1879 was
Auguste Pavie, the versatile French explorer, who was responsible for the
tel~g:aph line from Bangkok through Battambang, now part of Cambodia,
to JOlll the French line to Saigon.
In 1880 the British India government requested permission from the Sia~ese court to conduct a survey in Siam in order to complete the triangulatt~ns for .the boundary map of British India. They had completed their
tnangulattons from India to their eastern frontier, that is, Burma. To accomplish the boundary mapping of this front, however, they needed to make
connected triangulations into Siam. Thus the British India government
wanted to erect marking points on some of the highest places in Siamese territ~r_Y: The first proposed site was at the Golden Mountain in Bangkok, an
arttftctal ~onstruction only a few kilometers from the palace, symbolically
representmg the holy mountain for Bangkok, on top of which a stupa of the
Buddha relic resides. Another proposed location was at Phra Pathomchedi,
the greatest stupa in Siam, which is less than 50 kilometers southwest of
Bangkok. 22
The Siamese court was frightened. An urgent meeting of ministers and
senior officers was called to consider the request because many still believed
that such a survey was the first step of a foreign invasion. This reaction was
understandable, since it was not a survey for a construction project in a par-

118

Chapter Six

ticular locality, an undertaking with which the Siamese rulers were familiar.
Perhaps not many of them understood what a triangulation was. At that
time, there had been no survey of any large area of Bangkok. There were topographical surveys at many points along the borders, but none of them was a
survey on such a scale as a triangulation covering a huge area and a great
length of the frontier-and including the capital as part of the survey, probably the most threatening matter to the court. The proposed location of marking points, both of them sacred sites, was another cause of apprehension.
Indeed the proposal tells us a lot about the imperialistic insensitivity of the
British and modern geography. Besides, the initiative came from the British,
to be done by the British, for the benefit of the British.
Alabaster had no such apprehension. But presumably to allay Siamese fears,
he suggested that Siam should employ a British technician to undertake the
task of doing a map of Siam for the Siamese government to connect with
the British triangulations. King Chulalongkorn agreed. Thus James Fitzroy
McCarthy, known by his Thai title as Phra Wiphakphuwadon, became an
official in the service of the Siamese government. 23
The triangulations from India were completed and became the basis for the
surveys for the map of Siam. 24 But after that work was done, McCarthy and
his survey team returned to the modernizing projects. Some of their major
accomplishments were:
1881: the telegraph line between Tak of Siam and Moulmein of British Burma
1882: a map of Sampheng, the heart of the Chinese community in Bangkok, made
to increase the efficiency of the collection of the Chinese head taxes
1882-1883: a map of the boundary between Rahaeng and Chiangmai to settle
their dispute over the woodcutting tax
1883: a map of the boundary between Pattani and Perak, two Malay states-one
under Siam, the other under the British25

Yet this European technology was not so welcome to native people. Phraya
Maha-ammat (Seng), a successful surveyor and cartographer trained by
McCarthy, remarked that their work was obstructed even by the nobles,
who were afraid that their property might be confiscated. The mapping officials were overseen at every step while they were working. McCarthy himself complained many times in his journals that his work was harder than it
should have been because of hindrance from local officials. Seng's brother was
killed while surveying Sipsong Panna because the local people did not want
the work to be done. 26 Nonetheless, the change was coming, as McCarthy
noted in 1895 at the end of his successful career in Siam, reminiscing about
what he had encountered in his early days in Siam: "Surveying was regarded

Mapping

119

as of no use in the administration of the country, and as far more likely to
serve the purposes of a future invader than of the rightful owners of the
country. But it is time for such notions to come to an end, and for the work
to be put on a better footing." 27
For the rulers in Bangkok, the role of mapping had been expanding rapidly. It had become as necessary to Siam as roads, electricity, the telegraph,
and railways. The first group of mapping officials was formed as early as 1875
by selecting about fifty men from the Royal Bodyguard, the first Westernstyle regiment in Siam. It was called the "Military Engineers of the Royal
Bodyguard" under the command of Alabaster. 28 But only a few of them finished the training, and the scheme was dropped until McCarthy took the job
and began the training again in 1881.
In 1882 Damrong recommended the establishment of the first mapping
school to train officials to be assistants to the European technicians. The
school limited its students according to demand, and most of them were the
descendants of high-ranking government officials. Among the courses offered
in this school were Western mathematics and astronomy as well as the use of
sophisticated scientific devices. The students also learned to calculate coordinates and many other topographical measurements. 29 In fact, this school was
one of the few Western-style schools in Siam at the time. And it was the only
school run by the Siamese government which offered intensive studies of
English and Western scientific knowledge, since this knowledge was necessary for the job. But perhaps because it was a training school for a particular
purpose rather than a school for general education, studies on modern education in Thailand rarely mention anything about this institution. 3o
Three years later, in 1885, the Royal Survey Department was founded. It
was responsible for all surveys, planning, and mapping projects of the government. 31 Mapping was no longer a foreign technology in Siam.

The Making of"Our" Space by Maps
Phraya Maha-ammat (Seng) once said that when he joined the Interior Ministry in 1892 he was confident that his superiors knew the frontier towns by
name but could not identify their locations on a map. Perhaps, he added, they
were not so much concerned with problems on the borders. 3 2 This reminiscence was exaggerated, since border questions were already high on the
agenda of the Bangkok regime in 1892, and the maps of the frontier towns
must have been known to a number of rulers by that time. Nonetheless, such
a remark suggests that he recognized the transition from a time when the

120

Chapter Six

frontier towns were known by name to a time when they were known by a
map. This shift took place in rather a short period: the final two decades of
the nineteenth century.
A few years after the frightening triangulation request, the needs for mapping increased rapidly. The main impetus from the mid-1880s onward was,
however, not the construction of infrastructure. It was the need for the new
provincial administration mentioned earlier. As we may recognize from
McCarthy's works in 1882-1883, there was a problem of the boundary
between a town of Siam and Lanna and another between Pattani, a Siamese
tributary in the south, and Perak, then under British power. In fact the
whole country began to shift from the traditional hierarchical relationships of
rulers to the new administration on a territorial basis.
In the existing system of provincial control, which was based on the
hierarchical network of lordship among local rulers under the nobles in
Bangkok, a small town could request a change of dependence on one lord to
another, mostly after a dispute. The new lord might be the ruler of a town
which was not adjacent to it. The domain of a regional lord could even be
discontinuous. 33 Thus a town was known by its name, and in most cases
Bangkok had no idea about the domain of each regional center. Like the
court of Rama III which told the British to ask local inhabitants about the
khetdaen, the communications from the court of Mongkut to the towns on
the frontier inquiring about the boundaries in certain areas indicated that the
court did not know its realm territorially.
The reform, which began mostly in the major tributaries in Lanna and
along the Mekhong, not only tightened Bangkok's control but also reorganized the administration of the large and small towns. Bangkok officials
found that one of the major problems was that the territorial distribution of
lordships was chaotic. The solution was territorial redistribution-transferring several towns from one lord to another and abolishing some of them.
With the new geographic consciousness, Bangkok introduced two measures
necessary for the administration in every redistributed province, namely,
mapping and the registration of households. 34
The reform showed the dramatic transition in the conception of the realm
of Siam. For the first time the regime was attempting to know the units
which comprised the realm in territorial terms. Undoubtedly, this was a consequence of the new vision created by the modern geographical discourse of
mapping. Mapping was both a cognitive paradigm and a practical means of
the new administration. It demanded the reorganization and redistribution of
space to suit the new exercise of administrative power on a territorial basis.
The name of the new system-thesaphiban (protection of territory)-reflected

Mapping

121

these changes honestly. But the redistribution began around the same time as
the contest with the French over the Mekhong region. In this case, Chulalongkorn explicitly expressed his desire to have the border areas reorganized
and mapped as a measure to counter the French. 35 Formally the reform in
that region began rather late, in 1890, but actually it had started earlier.
It is striking that, from its early days in Siam, mapping was involved with
the desire to integrate the Lao region into the Siamese realm. In early 1884, a
Siamese prince suggested that the court should commission a team of surveyors and mapping officials to make a map of the upper Mekhong basin close to
Tonkin and Annam. McCarthy himself warned that trouble over the border
of those areas was imminent, so mapping was urgently needed. 36 Of course,
mapping had nothing to do with the suppression of the Ho, but the Siamese
rulers realized that it was a powerful means of dealing with the boundary
question.
For the first time in history, during January-July 1884 Bangkok troops
were accompanied by a group of mapping officials headed by McCarthy himself to survey the territories around Luang Phrabang and VientianeY From
then on until mid-1893, the so-called Siamese expedition to suppress the Ho
was always accompanied by surveyors and mapping technicians. Indeed mapmaking was a major mission of every expedition. Chulalongkorn's instruction to the Siamese troops in 1885 was straightforward: "The king would
like to know all the localities under his sovereignty.... For this reason, His
Majesty has commissioned a team of mapping officials to explore all localities
for accurate information. Hence all commanders and chief officers must support these mapping officials to carry out their mission." 38 Here, to know was
to know geographically. Surasakmontri's description of the campaigns
against the Ho was full of accounts about the nature of various localities, peoples, and his attempts to identify the exact location of each area with various
referential methods. It is obvious that maps were drawn as the troops
marched; then they were sent back to Bangkok from time to time. 39
It seems that Siam expected mapping to be the means which could determine once and for all the boundary of the realm. By mapping, that is to say,
the ambiguity of margins was expected to be eradicated and the clear-cut limits of the realm of Siam would appear. Mapping technology was no longer
alien or suspicious to them. Apparently they realized that in order to counter
the French claim, modern geography was the only geographical language the
West would hear and only a modern map could make an argument. Mapping
had frightened the court in the early years of the reign. Now it became an
indispensable technology to decide and establish the geo-body of Siam.
All the initiatives about mapping, however, also indicate that until that

122

Chapter Six

moment Siam had no evidence of this kind in hand to substantiate its claims.
To finish such a herculean task within a short time after a few trips was
hardly imaginable; but whether or not the Siamese rulers realized this technical imperative is difficult to know. Perhaps a historian's comment that the
Siamese elite overestimated their military capability, but were inadequately
prepared in real terms, can be applied to their handling of mapping as well. 40
They were ready to use a map to substantiate their claim both on the battlefield and at the negotiation table. But not even one map of the boundary of
that frontier was completed before the crisis broke out in 1893.
The 1884 survey was the first such project ever carried out by Siam-apart
from Duysart's exploration, whose result was unknown-and was among
the first undertaken by any European. Although a number of French explorers had been to the area since the 1860s, a satisfactory result had not been
achieved, let alone a scientific map of the area. The 1884 survey failed, however, due to a serious fever which incapacitated almost everyone on the team
and took the life of an English technician. 41 The surveys of frontiers were
regularly carried out in every dry season-October or November to May-of
the following years. By early 1887, the mapping officials had reached
Thaeng, Sipsong Chuthai, Huaphan, Phuan, and many other small chiefdoms. But the projects accomplished in those years were merely topographical surveys.

Mapping Cross Fire: A Lethal Weapon Unleashed
Siam did not map alone. French explorers had already been in the region for
several decades. They were motivated by a conviction that the Mekhong
could be an access to the mysterious but rich southern part of China. Henri
Mouhot was the first to reach Luang Phrabang in 1860-1861, but illness
took his life before he could travel further. 42 Doudart de Lagree and Francis
Garnier followed this endeavor in 1866-1868, the first Europeans to make a
map of the Mekhong countries from actual surveys. 43 The prime agent of the
French interest in the contest with Siam in the 1880s and 1890s was Auguste
Pavie. After being an employee of the Siamese regime for a telegraph project
in 1878-1879, throughout the following decade Pavie and a team of French
explorers had been working for the French Indochina government to explore
the areas of northern Laos.
In 1886 Pavie, on behalf of the French government, requested Siam's permission to establish a consulate at Luang Phrabang. Chulalongkorn argued
that the need for a consul was not to protect French subjects since at that
time there was not a significant number of them in Laos. The objective was

Mapping

123

explicitly for mapping in the region. 44 Although the proposal for a consulate
was turned down, Pavie kept working, traveling throughout the region
mostly with the protection of the Siamese forces. Pavie and his surveying
operations represented French interests before any military presence. His
mapping projects spearheaded French colonial power, yet another sign of the
new technology's force.
Certainly Siam felt the threat of Pavie's actions. Several times in Pavie's
accounts and diary, he tells us he was hindered or obstructed by Siamese officials. Even if the complaints were exaggerated to overvalue his role in the
eventual achievement, it seems that they were true to a certain extent. Some
of the obstructions are confirmed by Thai sources, which admit them explicitly as measures necessary for Siam's benefit-for example, in 1888 Siam
repeatedly demanded recognition of its rights over Luang Phrabang before
Pavie could conduct a survey. Siam also sent a number of officials to keep an
eye on Pavie throughout his journey. And there are several other initiatives
which, from Pavie's view, were assigned by Bangkok to hinder his surveys.
Each time the obstruction resulted in a delay of several days. 45 Pavie complained that he was disturbed by these men all the time. They did not understand his work and suspected him for being so interested in collecting insects,
flowers, and ancient inscriptions. The Siamese were also suspicious, of
course, of Pavie's interest in local traditions and in taking photographs.
Once, he tells us, he blurted out: "I am very distressed because you inconvenience me ... without gain for your side .... I only ask you to help me by
showing me the boundaries common with ours ... [names of towns]." 46 In
the early years, however, without the presence of French forces, Pavie had to
rely on the Siamese for protection, supplies, and preparation for every step of
his journey. So he could not avoid Siam's interference. But nobody could
show him what he wanted: boundary.
It is not surprising that Siam's mapping officials urgently advanced their
survey, trying to cover the areas claimed by Siam as extensively and quickly as
possible. At one point McCarthy requested authority from the king to move
forward to areas where troops had yet to go but had been delayed by administrative work in the conquered towns. Enthusiastically, McCarthy suggested
that he could ask local people about the histories of these towns to decide
where he should locate the boundary and map it. "We, then, can know the
land where we live," he wrote to the king. The king, perhaps not less enthusiastic, praised him but warned: "It seems that [McCarthy] will decide the
boundaries by himself." 47 Consciously or not, that is precisely what
McCarthy was doing. He realized the power of mapping. On one occasion
he told local rulers and warlords that the king had sent him to survey the

124

Chapter Six

region, "so that the peoples in the outer towns will know for certain up to
which points the Thai territory extended." 48
•
•
Eventually, the French force arrived. At the Thaeng confrontatlon m
1888, not only did each side demand that the other retreat, but they also put
forward the intention to send surveyors into the territory occupied by one
another. Surasakmontri reported Pavie's saying that his map of Sipsong Chuthai was good enough for determining the boundary and there was no need
for Siam's surveyors to advance into that area. 49 Pavie reported that Surasakmontri tried to persuade him twice in 1887 and 1888 to use the map Siam had
made, which, of course, showed the realm of Siam extending beyond the
upper Mekhong basin. 5o While both claimed the territory and proposed their
maps as the basis of negotiation, they implied that their maps were not yet
complete, so more surveys were needed. Finally, despite the military status
quo, they accepted the fact that their maps were only preliminary ones. They
therefore allowed each other's surveyors to continue their work in the opponent's occupied territories for the benefit of the supposed negotiation in
Bangkok.
The competition in surveying and mapping by both Siam and France
accompanied the political turmoil in the Mekhong region. For Siam, the surveys for boundary mapping from 1884 can be summed up as follows:
1884: topographical survey of the northeast frontier around Luang Phrabang,
Sipsong Chuthai, Huaphan, and Phuan
1884-1885: travel to Luang Phrabang by a different route through Nan and topographical survey of the country around Luang Phrabang
.
1885-1886: travel to Luang Phrabang but failure to do any work owmg to late
arrival of the troops
1886-1887: travel to Chiangmai, Luang Phrabang, and Thaeng and survey for
military and administrative purposes
1887-1889: survey for the Bangkok-Chiangmai railway
1890-1891: mapping of the boundary on the frontier between Siam and Burma
1891: triangulation of the northern frontier to connect with the system of
triangulation from British India's eastern frontier; survey of the northwestern frontier and completion of the boundary map of this part
1892-1893: continuing triangulation from the northwest and north of Lanna eastward across Luang Phrabang and the areas northeast to south of Luang
Phrabang51

A map which has provided crucial evidence in supporting Siam's _clai~­
both in those days as well as retrospectively in the argument by h1stonans
today-is the so-called 1887 McCarthy map. 52 Drawn up six years befor~ the
1893 crisis, it is regarded now in Thailand as the first modern map of S1a~.
Thai historians of the Franco-Siamese conflict always refer to the map as 1t

was illustrated in an article by George Curzon, however, without having
seen the original. Lord Curzon, a prominent colonialist in British politics, a
geographer, and later a viceroy of British India, wrote that article published
in July 1893 mainly to discuss British policy in the wake of the French
advance in Indochina. His map shows three proposed maps of the boundary
between Siam and Vietnam: one by McCarthy in 1887, the other two by
French explorers in 1866-1868 and 1892 (see Figure 9). He challenged both
French maps, exposing their unreliability and confusing data. Strikingly, he
did not say a word about McCarthy's map. 53
In 1985 the Royal Thai Survey Department reproduced a map entitled
"The 1887 Map of Siam and Its Dependencies" by James McCarthy. It is definitely not McCarthy's 1887 map, however, since it shows Siam's boundary
after the 1893 treaty with France and in fact gives several names of provinces
which had not been so named until 1899 (and one not until 1906). 54 From
1884 to 1887 McCarthy had two failed and two successful seasons of surveys,
all carried out in the upper Mekhong basin between Luang Phrabang and Sipsong Chuthai. All were topographical surveys. The actual measurement,
which had to start with a triangulation connecting from the western border,
had not begun until the 1890-1891 season. McCarthy returned to England
briefly in 1887, giving an address on his surveys in Siam to the prestigious
Royal Geographic Society in November of that year. Actually, the map was
printed in 1888, not 1887. 55
The original map was similar to the one appearing in Curzon's article. It
covered the entire Siamese realm, with focus on the Mekhong region. A colored line supposed to be the boundary was drawn from Chiang Khaeng (on
the Burma-Laos border today) to the Black River, covering parts of Sipsong
Chuthai, the whole of Huaphan and Phuan, then southward along the
mountain ranges parallel with the coast to latitude 13 degrees north, then
westward to join the boundary already agreed on at Battambang (Figure 10).
As it appears, it was a rendering into map form of the conviction and desire
held by the Siamese elite to see Siam on a map. Like all other proposed
boundaries which were interpretations of the ambiguous territorial margins
by the new code of space, McCarthy's map was just another spatial speculation and the encoding of desire.
Pavie, on the other hand, mentioned several times in his books that the
boundaries had yet to be decided. He claimed the territory on behalf of the
French, but he was also aware that there was no boundary yet. In most of the
maps published in his books no boundary was identified, except the short one
on the Battambang-Siamreap front between Siam and Cambodia which was
the result of the 1867 treaty between Mongkut's envoy and Paris. No one

T
126

Chapter Six

knows for sure whether the absence of boundary lines between Siam and
French Indochina in Pavie's books was cunningly deliberate-to leave the
question open for additional claims-or was due to his scientific rigidity
which did not allow him to specify a boundary line while the demarcation
was not yet finished.
Although the Siamese rulers were confident in their cause, either by conviction of their historical rights or by unrealistic overconfidence in their military capability and map or both, they wanted to avoid a collision. Chulalongkorn strongly warned that any dispute which might lead to a military
clash should be deferred to the negotiation table in Bangkok. One of the
solutions to avoid such an undesirable clash was to establish a joint commission to survey and mark the boundaries since 1887. 56 But the commission
yielded no result. As is usual in this sort of conflict, both sides accused one
another of undermining the commission and thereby the negotiation in several ways, while professing firm determination for a peaceful solutionY
The relation between map and military force was remarkable. The desire of
the force was to make the territory exclusive and map it. In actual practice,
the operation of the force was planned and guided by the preliminary maps of
the areas. 58 As the case of McCarthy's request may suggest, sometimes mapping advanced one step ahead of the troops; then the military operation followed, making the mapping proposal of the areas come true. Mapping
spearheaded the conquest. Nevertheless, since the spheres of influence of both
sides had never been defined and in fact were overlapping, a modern boundary could be anywhere in those marginal-in every sense of the word-areas.
A proposed boundary therefore was a speculation which, depending on one's
point of view, was equally truer and falser than another proposal. In actual
practice, the survey of an area by one side was done alongside the military
advance. The military decided the extent of territorial sovereignty and provided the authority under which mapping could be executed, not vice versa.
Force defined the space. Mapping vindicated it. Without military force, mapping alone was inadequate to claim a legitimate space. But the legitimation of
the military presence was always substantiated by a map. Mapping and military became a single set of mutually reinforcing technology to exercise power
over space in order to define and create the geo-body of Siam.
The relationship between a mapmaker and the military operation in this
process was even more striking. James F. McCarthy was not merely a surveyor and technician. From the 1884 start of the operation in the Mekhong
region, he was involved in a great deal of strategic and operational planning
as one who knew the area best. His findings led him to point out that the Siamese force could effectively take control of the entire Phuan and Huaphan

the Phuan center, as 1ts headquarters. The successful military campaign of
1885-1888 that resulted was generally attributed to his recommendation.
Througho~t the operation.' McCarthy's reports of his surveys played a great
role both m the field and m Bangkok. Geography lent him the authority to
recommend th_e occupation of specific towns. Through McCarthy, geography gave the S1amese force the knowledge of where to establish a border control and boundary markings. It was McCarthy who drafted the operation

and support the military operation. 59
By 18_93 tensi~n was high. Sporadic minor clashes erupted along the borders wh1le mappmg officials of both sides carried out their work. McCarthy
led the survey teams for the triangulations from the west and north of Lanna
urgently moving eastward through the Lao regions from 1890 to 1893 with:
out returning to Bangkok as usual until the Paknam crisis broke out in July
1893. This continuous project was supposed to map the boundaries between
Siam and British Burma and then make triangulations from that point eastward through Nan, Luang Phrabang, Phuan, Champasak, and Ubon to join
the existing ~o.undary at Battambang. The work was brought to an abrupt
halt by the cns1s, however, when only a little over half of the projected areas
had been covered. 60 McCarthy was on a mountain when the news about the
French blockade of the Chao Phraya River arrived, along with a dispatch
from Bangkok ordering him to return to Bangkok immediately. Mapping
was under way on the mountain while the issue was about to be decided in
t~e river. The geo-body was being created literally on paper. A new life for
S1am was about to begin.

Emergence of the Ceo-Body: A Victory of Mapping

THE MAP oF BOUNDED SIAM appeared for the first time after the Paknam crisis
of 1893. Ironically, it was eventually an outcome of cooperation between
Britain, France, and Siam. By 1893, only the boundary and map of the western front between Siam and Burma were finished. On all other fronts, except
for a short boundary at Battambang and the one between Kedah and Perak,
there were only topographical surveys and sketches. So all the data and work
done by the Siamese and French mapping officials were gathered. together
with British cooperation. In 1897 two maps were produced by S1am. The
first one was published in England. 1 The other map, published in Calcutta
under the title Phaenthi phraratcha-anakhet sayam r.s. 116 (Map of the Boundary of Siam 1897), was drawn by two Thai officials named Son and Baeb. 2
Both maps stated clearly that whenever there was a gap in th_e surve! ~y
Siam, the maps drawn by the British and French had been cop1ed to f1ll m
the missing sections. Practically and symbolically, Siam had its first geo-body
and its representation made, filled, and shaped, at least in part, by Western
powers.
.
.
Auguste Pavie published a detailed map of the area m 1902. H1s map,
regarded as the most reliable and informative of its time, was basically. a topographical map showing details of natural features. No b~undary hne was
shown on any frontier except that separating Siam and Briush Burma, probably copied from the work done by McCarthy and the British between 1890
and 1891. There was no boundary in the Mekhong region.
The geo-body of Siam was reshaped by many treaties with Britain and
France in 1893, 1899, 1902, 1904, and 1907 and by means of cartographic
techniques. Siam and both superpowers set up many committees_ to decide
the boundaries and many detailed ad hoc agreements for each sectiOn of the
boundary with specific maps for each. 3 It is an irony that Pavie's map was the

It depends on one's point of view whether the contest between Siam and
France for the upper Mekhong and the entire Lao region was a loss or a gain
of Siam's territory. But it certainly signaled the emergence of the geo-body of
Siam. And the ultimate loser was not in fact Siam. The losers were those tiny
chiefdoms along the routes of both the Siamese and the French forces. Not
only were they conquered-a fate by no means peculiar to them-but they
were also transformed into integral parts of the new political space defined by
the new notions of sovereignty and boundary. Another ultimate loser was
the indigenous knowledge of political space. Modern geography displaced it,
and the regime of mapping became hegemonic.
It was this triumph of modern geography that eliminated the possibility,
let alone opportunity, of those tiny chiefdoms being allowed to exist as they
had done for centuries. In other words, the modern discourse of mapping
was the ultimate conqueror. Its power was exercised through the actions of
major agents representing the contending countries. The new geographical
knowledge was the force behind every stage of conceiving, projecting, and
creating the new entity.
From the beginning, it was a new knowledge-a new geographical "language" by which information originated and the new notion of the realm of
Siam was conceived. It became a framework for thinking, imagining, and
projecting the desired realm; it became in effect the language in which Siam
was to be discussed. But since the reality did not yet exist, the new geography served as the vision for the geo-body of Siam still to be created. Its requisites-the new kind of boundary, sovereignty, and margin-were formed at
various moments in time and place and in different fashions. When all parties
involved became preoccupied by the new conception of a state, drafts and
sketches of the limits of Siam were drawn even before an actual survey was
carried out. Siam's geo-body was anticipated, and desired, by all parties. But
the anticipated extent of the entity to be created was varied. The imperialist
concept of the two European powers and the royal hegemonic ambition of
Siam were in conflict.
At that point, mapping was no longer merely a conceptual tool for spatial
representation. It became a lethal instrument to concretize the projected

130

Chapter Seven

desire on the earth's surface. Not only was mapping a necessary device for
new administrative mechanisms and for military purposes-functions that
seemed modest and merely instrumental-but indeed the discourse of mapping was the paradigm within which both administrative and military operations worked and served. In other words, mapping turned both operations
into its mechanism to realize its projection, to concretize its "enunciation."
It transformed human beings of all nations, people whose actions were heroic
or savage, honorable or demeaning, into its agents to make the mapped space
come true. Siam was bounded. Its geo-body emerged. Mapping created a
new Siam-a new entity whose geo-body had never existed before.
Communication theory and common sense alike persuade us that a map is a
scientific abstraction of reality. A map merely represents something which
already exists objectively. In the history of the geo-body, this relationship
was reversed. A map anticipated a spatial reality, not vice versa. In other
words, a map was a model for, rather than a model of, what it purported to
represent. A map was not a transparent medium between human beings and
space. It was an active mediator. In this case, all the requisites of the map of a
nation had not been given in premodern Siam and thus had to be created to
meet the demands of a map. The outcome was the result of the contending
anticipation expressed on each claimant's map. Perhaps more than has been
realized, the regime of mapping did not passively reflect Siam. Rather, it has
actively structured "Siam" in our minds as well as on earth.
In fact, the ambiguous relationship between a map and its anticipated
object-and the potential of the reverse relationship-can be found in the
ambiguity of the notion of geography itself. In English, "geography," as
well as phumisat in Thai, refers to the knowledge or study of a spatial object
as well as to such an object itself. The ambiguous and intricate relationship
between the two notions indicates that an object can be what a knowledge of
it allows it to be. Of course, we may question the relationships of other
branches of knowledge and their object (subject of study), especially those
whose double notions are signified by the same term, such as history.
In a conventional history, the making of modern Siam was often seen as
the outcome of the reform and modernization undertaken by the Siamese
elite. Siam's territory was the outcome of the "national integration" which
consolidated its formerly disintegrated units by means of "internal" mechanisms. The West was an "external" power which jeopardized the survival of
Siam and dismembered "parts of its body." Siam appeared as much victimized as the West appeared cruel. In the history of the geo-body, however, the
annexation of the otherwise autonomous units was executed ambitiously and
aggressively by the new administrative mechanism as well as by military
force. But together they were only one side of the attempt to inscribe the

Ceo-Body

131

geo-body of Siam on the earth's surface. They were the positive identification
of the realm of Our space.
The other side of the emergence of Siam's geo-body was the making of the
Others' space by the imperialists. Through diplomacy and military conquest,
they delimited the extremities of the domain of Siam's space by identifying
the limits of domains of their colonies. The Others surrounding Siam were
also concretized and delimited in the same process. What distinguished Siam
from the Others was not language, culture, or religion, since Siam took over
many formerly "foreign" tributaries as parts of its realm. It was simply
the space that was left over from direct colonialism. Siam was the space
in-between. This was a negative identification of the geo-body of Siam.
Whether Siam lost its territories to the imperialists or simply was the loser in
the expansionist contest depends on one's perspective. But the indisputable
fact remains: the colonial powers helped constitute the present geo-body of
Siam.
The emergence of the geo-body of Siam was not a gradual evolution from
the indigenous political space to a modern one. It was a displacement of the
former by the latter at various moments both by foreign powers and by the
Siamese themselves. Strategically, the new discourse threatened, destabilized,
or simply made the existing discourse ambiguous and then displaced it. The
presence of the geo-body of Siam is an effect of the hegemony of modern
geography and mapping. It is a phenomenon in which a domain of human
space has been inscribed in one way rather than another. This phenomenon
will last as long as the knowledge that inscribes it remains hegemonic. Not
only is the geo-body of a nation a modern creation; if we perceive history in a
longue duree of the earth's surface and humankind, it is also ephemeral. There
are other knowledges of space, either residual or emerging, operating to contend with the geo-body. The presence of the geo-body is always subject to
challenge.

The Ceo-Body Empowered
The fetishism of nationhood in modern times is mysterious and begs explanation. Robert Sack suggests that people tend to think about territoriality as a
natural entity, as the place to which they belong emotionally and spiritually. s
In one of the latest attempts, Ben Anderson resorts to the relation between a
nation and nature. He argues that by making a nation natural, the sense of
belonging naturally to a common identity is created-hence the sacredness
and the grip of nationhood. 6
The birth of many early European nations was based on long-standing
common features like language, ethnicity, or even political adherence. These

Chapter Seven

132

features were regarded as almost intrinsic parts of the identity. The boundary
of a community was thus easily seen as natural as well. But an undeniable fact
remains: every boundary is artificial. All are prescribed, not naturally given,
although some may seem more natural than others. 7
Prescriptive methods range from the adoption of natural features like a
mountain, a river, or a watershed to the calculation of coordinates (as in the
case of many African countries), or an extremely arbitrary line on a map (as in
the case of India-Pakistan which cost thousands of lives), or the construction
of a road, fences, posts, or The Wall. The question, however, remains: how
has an artifact like a geo-body been made natural?
A simple lesson in one of the earliest geographical textbooks in Siam illuminates a strategy of intellectual indoctrination which helps naturalize, in
every sense of the word, the geo-body. Here Uncle teaches two boys:
Uncle: You already know that the earth is spherical, but do you know how the
earth divides?
Chun: The earth divides into three parts of water and one ofland.
Uncle: Right. But how does the land divide?
Chom: Into continents, sir.
Uncle: Can a continent be divided?
Chun and Chom: No.
Uncle: Our earth can be divided into large portions called continents, and a continent can be divided into nations (prathet). Many nations are all different.
China is one of the big countries; Siam is a small one." 8

This lesson about the earth's surface is simple but remarkable. What is
striking is the mixture of geographical categories: nations and natural features. A nation becomes a natural component of the earth's surface like the
terra firma and the oceans. The only distinction between them is simply one of
size. A similar pattern of description can be found in most of the early geography books in Siam mentioned earlier and perhaps in most of the ones today.
Van Dyke's book, an elementary atlas of nations, started from the earth's surface and then divided it into nations on each continent without describing the
natural features. Perhaps everyone in our generation has experienced this
phase of geographical learning which posits the concept of a nation in the
same category as natural features. It should be noted, however, that in the
case of Siam the only exception among the books of that earliest generation is
Tamra phichika-phumisat (A Text on Physical Geography), written in 1901 but
first published in 1918. This book's description of the physical features of the
earth's surface, from the atmosphere down to the core of the earth, did not
9

include a nation.
The naturalization, literally, of the geo-body can be done at one stroke

Ceo-Body

133

since its material basis is the earth's surface. Its representations, including
terms like phumisat and prathet, maintain their referent and root in the earth or
soil. For most Southeast Asian cultures, the soil is a crucial part of human
genesis and civilization. Either the naga, the underworld serpent, or the goddess of the earth (soil) is the mother of humankind. The notion of motherland is indeed deeply rooted in every culture in one form or another. In premodern times, that soil or motherland could be the land marked by temples,
natural li;nits, the soil of the tribes or clans who shared the same myth of
genesis, the sphere of the same supreme overlord. In our time, that motherland is represented by the geo-body. The geo-body supplies the new objectification for the beloved motherland or common soil and, reciprocally, acquires
the human loyalty originally given to the soil. As the soil had been an identification of commonality, the geo-body has been given the concrete magnitude of the soil while it makes itself an identification of commonality. Not
only was the geo-body naturalized but it was also given what Clifford Geertz
might call the primordial sentiment by the soil. to
Being natural, however, is not the only strategic discourse by which the
geo-body can create the sense of belonging to the same community. The significance of soil or the earth may vary from one culture to another, while
there may be other mediation for communal identification. The geo-body can
become a powerful totem of a national tribe by its association to these other
kinds of communal identification. Its fetishistic power does not depend on its
"naturalness" alone. It also comes from the conjunction with other totems,
especially indigenous or traditional ones. A splendid example in the case of
Siam is the relationship between the geo-body and kingship.
In many premodern societies in Southeast Asia, a realm, a kingdom, or a
country was believed to be an extended body of the divine kingship, which is
in turn a personification of sacred power. But a realm was not a bounded, territorial state. As Shelley Errington suggests in the case of the Buginese society, the body of kingship is not merely the biological body. It is the entire
entourage, including his followers and the subordinate rulers within the
realm. 11 A comparable case can be found in the Mon notion of a realm as a
federation of princes and nat (local spirits). In the case of Siam, the body of
kingship was not only the biological body either. A passage in Ramakian, the
Thai version of the Ramayana believed to have been composed by King Rama
I of Bangkok (r. 1782-1809), says:
All the cities are the body,
The king is the mind,
Which is the lord of the body. 12

134

Chapter Seven

The country, the kingdom, or the realm is always expressed as the royal
property, such as phraratcha-anakhet (the royal sphere) or phraratcha-anachak
(the royal kingdom). This means that territory was not profane; it was a
component of the royal body. When the geo-body displaced the premodern
nonbounded, hierarchical realm, the manifestation of the royal body emerged
in a new form. But it was still very much the royal body. After the 1893 crisis had passed, the king was deeply saddened. Yet he ultimately recovered,
and, according to one of the courtiers, he had a good reason to console himself: "The loss of those margins along the border of the phraratcha-anachak
[the royal kingdom], which we could not look after anyway, was like the loss
of our fingertips. They are distant from our heart and torso, and it is these
we must protect to our utmost ability." 13 The semiological transaction is
always a two-way exchange. The royal realm, then, had taken a new embodiment. The king's extended body was now a little patchwork on a blue
planet, no more the center of the universe or the southern continent of the
Hindu-Buddhist cosmology. But in that semiological shift, the sanctity of
royalness was transferred and transposed to the geo-body as well.
Perhaps the most significant semiological conjunction and shift involve the
notion of chat or "a nation" itself. Etymologically, chat, cha-ti, cha-ta mean a
birth or a collective noun for being born of a common origin, ethnically,
temporally, or socially. In Bradley's 1873 Thai dictionary, chat still meant
such. Thus his examples of the word included chatna (next birth), chatthai
(born as a Thai), chatphrai (born as a serf), chatkasat (born as a king), and
chatrna (born, and behave, like a dog), which is still a famous swearword even
today. The word for "ethnic" in Thai now is chatphan. And cha-ta still preserves its original meaning as a birth. Around the end of the nineteenth century, the meaning of chat shifted significantly.
Two scholars have studied this shift by using Anderson's idea of the official
nationalism. 14 Basically they explain how the Siamese state at the time had
nurtured the notion of a "nation" out of traditional concepts embedded in
the term chat. What they also show, though unintentionally, is the trace of
semiological shifts and conjunction caused by the force of the newly emerging geo-body.
Formerly, to talk about a country, a governed spatial unit, the term was
either rnuang or banrnuang, literally town and village-town respectively.
Despite its connotation of space, however, banrnuang was not spatially
defined. It was a generic term meaning a country, the realm of a monarch.
Chat had no semantic relation to a space at all; it referred to the commonality
of origin. After only a slight shift in the late nineteenth century, chat came to
mean a community of people who shared a cultural commonality particularly

Ceo-Body

135

defined by being the subjects of the same monarch. Both chat and banrnuang
therefore came to signify a common cultural and geographical community
defined by the royal power. The geo-body then provided the new spatial definition for the royal sphere of such a community. As mentioned earlier, it
came via modern geography-via the word formerly signifying an unspecified spatial unit: prathet. A semiological conjunction took place in which the
power and values imbued in the terms banrnuang and chat-common origin,
cultural commonality, soil, and royal sanctity-met those of the geo-body
and were transferred to each other. The rendezvous of this conjunction is at
the terms chat and prathet. Chat, whose root is in the sense of a common identity, and prathet, whose root is in space, became synonymous; each conferred
meanings and values upon the other. In fact, since then they are usually
expressed as one word: prathetchat or chatprathet. 15 The words are a meticulous
invention combining traditional values with a modern concrete embodiment.
The conjunctions of the concept of geo-body with other communal identifications have generated broader and more complex significations for the geobody. Powerful values are added to it once its signification extends beyond
territoriality-encroaching upon the notion of soil, chat, and the royal sphere
of power, for example. It now represents not only the territory but also the
organic community to which people belong as well. It is obvious that the
fetishistic power of the geo-body not only lies in its fabricated naturalness,
but significantly increases by means of its intercourse with other powerful
discourses, especially by transferring traditional values to enrich its presence.
Its life is diabolically generative.

Beyond Territory and Geography
As a two-way traffic of signification and values, however, while the geobody gains additional meanings and values, it becomes a force pushing for the
shifts of meanings of other discourses too. Again, a good example is the relationship between the geo-body and kingship. A specific case is the concept of
ekkarat and itsaraphap. Nowadays, both terms are equivalent to "independence." An ekkarat country means an independent one. The loss of ekkarat
means becoming a colony. In all Thai dictionaries compiled in the nineteenth
century, however, ekkarat and itsaraphap never meant independence. Take, for
example, Pallegoix 1854 (Thai-English-Latin):t6

ekkara: superior; one who does not fear others; bold, haughty
ekkaraat: king, superior to others
itsaraat: king, superior to others
itsaraaphaap: supreme power

136

Chapter Seven

itsaaraphaap: having supreme authority
itsara, itsaro: first, excellent, domineering over others
Or Bradley 1873 (Thai-Thai): 17
ekkara: one who is bold, haughty
ekkarat: one king
itsaro, itsara: superior to others such as a king
(There is no itsaraphap in this dictionary.)
Or Khun Prasert-aksonnit 1891 (Thai-Thai): 18
ekkarat, ekkarajaya: the king in a prathet
itson, itsara, isuan: the king, the god
In Smith's English-Thai dictionary of 1899, the words "dependence" and
"dependency" find their nearest counterpart in the term muangkhun. 19 Of
course, the term denotes the hierarchical relationship of overlordship rather
than a colony. For "independence," Smith found no specific Thai word and
thus explained it as "not dependent on anyone, not under the subjection of
anyone, to be master of oneself, to be free and not in bondage to anyone." 20
As these dictionaries inform us, ekkarat and itsaraphap at that time denoted
the supreme monarch-a double notion of being the supreme one and therefore being second to none. Both terms signified the status at the apex of the
hierarchy. In Sangkhitiyawong, for example, a Buddhist text in Pali written by
a monk in the late eighteenth century, an ekkarat king, not country, was jealous of the itsaraphap of other kings. 21 Another example: in every version of
the royal chronicles, all written before the mid-nineteenth century, there is a
story of when Siam was defeated and became a tributary of Burma in the late
sixteenth century. Later the Burmese king was suspicious that a Thai prince
was about to revolt. Here every chronicle says that the Burmese king plotted
an assassination of his adversary in order to achieve "a greater itsaraphap than
other cities." Itsaraphap meant supremacy, not independence. It was Burma
that sought itsaraphap over Siam, rather than Siam attempting to do so from
Burma. 22 In the hierarchical relation of kings, to say that a tributary king
suddenly fought for itsaraphap would seem senseless since it would take him
some time to achieve that supremacy.
When the context shifted from the hierarchical relation to the international and the units of relation were territorial states, the notion of ekkarat
thus shifted from the supremacy of a monarchy to the status of a modern
state in relation to others. Without hierarchical overlordship, the old meaning no longer made any sense. The shift eradicated the notion of supremacy

Geo-Body

137

in a hierarchy while preserving the other notion of the term which meant
depending on no one. From the early decades of the twentieth century
onward, the notions of ekkarat and itsaraphap have nothing to do with the
status of kingship. A new denotation given to them is equal to "independence." Etymologically, both terms might have lost their condition of existence when the indigenous concept of hierarchical relation was displaced. The
conjunction with the new geographical concept, however, shifted their
meanings and let them survive. The geo-body actively takes part in generating new ideas, new values, and new culture even beyond its primary task of
spatial definition.
The role of the map of Siam has been similarly active not only in representing the territory of Siam but in conveying other meanings and values as well.
A map is frequently used to represent nationhood-to arouse nationalism,
patriotism, or other messages about the nation. Figure 11 shows the leadership of the Siamese monarchs lifting Siam above the level of Burma, Cambodia, and Vietnam who are left pleading for help. This cartoon, however, is
slightly different from the original which won the contest of King
Vajiravudh. In the original, on the swing was not a man but the map of
Siam. 23
As a symbol of nationhood, the map of Siam has become one of the most
popular logos for organizations, political parties, business firms, and trademarks. The use of a map may become more serious if it is indispensable for
conveying the proper message of a particular symbol or is designed to arouse
sentimental effects. Figure 12 is the symbol of the Saichaithai Foundation
under the patronage of the Thai royal family. The foundation works for soldiers, the police, or members of other paramilitary forces injured or disabled
in the course of fighting all sorts of "enemies" to protect the nation. The
symbol of the foundation is composed of the map of Thailand, a pagoda, the
royal emblem, and a heart with blood. The symbol is powerful indeed; it is
dense with obvious meanings. It is a deliberate combination. The map is here
to control its proper meaning. A similar densely meaningful symbol is that of
the Village Scout. This popular royalist organization was active in Thai politics in the late 1970s, especially in the massacre of the student movement in
October 1976. 24 The key symbol of the Village Scouts is the crimson scarf
carried by each member. The emblem on the scarf is the map of Thailand in
yellow with the word "Thai" in blue across the map.
Sometimes the appearance of a map is not serious since it is not designed
for any sentimental effect. In commercial usage, for example, a map may be
decorated, distorted, or transformed for visual appeal. It may not look like a

138

Chapter Seven

map at all. It may be a caricature of the map of a nation used in a very casual
manner. Imagine what would happen if a casual or distorted map replaced the
serious map in the emblem of the Saichaithai Foundation and on the scarf of a
Village Scout. Can a proper meaning be transmitted? Can a caricature of a
map arouse nationalism, royalism, or other serious sentimental responses?
A map is usually taken out of its contextual origin, that is, the earth's surface. In many cases, there is no symbol to indicate the coordinates or the surrounding countries as in a geographical textbook. A map may float. Moreover, there may be no mapping symbol or any convention. Yet floating maps
even without mapping conventions can communicate to anyone familiar with
the map. This is because all the maps in the emblems and advertisements cited
above are no longer maps. They no longer represent the nation's territoriality. Rather, they are signifiers which signify the map of a nation. They are
signs of the map of a nation. They have meanings and values and can send
messages because they refer to the map of such a nation, which has been
loaded with the meanings and values of nationhood. In other words, the map
of a nation becomes a signified. In the words of Roland Barthes, it becomes a
metasign: it has become an adequately meaningful sign in itself, not necessarily with a further reference to the territoriality of that nation. By signifying
the map of that nation, these maplike signs can signify other meanings and
values carried by the map. And in the reverse direction, becoming a metasign, the map of a nation can generate values and meanings which have nothing to do with territory at all.
At this point, we may realize that the relationship between a map and
space becomes even more complex. It is hard to confine a map to its assumed
nature as a spatial representation. It has moved too far away from its technical
origin to return to its creator, the cartographer. It no longer belongs to the
cartographer, who has lost control over it completely. Independent of the
object as well as its human creator, it becomes a common property in the discourse of a nation.
In many ways, a map contributes its share to the human knowledge of a
nation. As a sign, it is an effective and active mediation which can even create
a geo-body; as a metasign, it is an object of reference in itself and can create
more meanings and values beyond its origin. In addition to the fact that it
monopolizes the means of human conceptualization of the artificial macrospace called a nation, both roles allow it to reign comfortably over the
domain of knowledge of nationhood and also bring it close to being a natural
entity.
By way of example, we can perhaps point to a never-ending number of
cases in which the geo-body and a map as a discourse, knowledge, a sign, a

Ceo-Body

139

metasign, operate to generate meanings and conceptual shifts. But one of the
mo~t significant effects the geo-body and a map have on our knowledge is
~hetr power to shape our conception of the past. Here the issue is the conJ~ncture between the new geographical knowledge and that of the past. How
dtd the ~eo-body and map generate history? In what ways must history be
~ha~ged 1~ order to come to terms with the emergence of the geo-body and
tts dtsrupttve origin?

-KING BHUMIPHOL (the present king of Thailand)

HISTORY IS INDEED SIGNIFICANT to the life of nationhood. The king's words
quoted above reflect that fact, reproduce it, and transmit it persuasive!!. But
why is prathetthai meaningless without the former centers of the Stamese
kingdom? Why would Thai people today find the word unambiguously
intelligible? How has the intelligibility of the king's statement been established? How did the discourse of the nation's history come into existence?
To talk about the past, one may think about what happened. But the fact is
that only what we can recall can constitute the body of the past which is
meaningful to us. In English, the past is what can be re-collected. The past
exists in relation to our constitution of the knowledge of it. The past we can
know, therefore, is always a representation of it which is created from our
own conceptions but believed to be the true past. History, a field of study, is
always a discourse of the past. It is a language that can make the elements recollected meaningful and intelligible. It is not so much a matter of discovering
fragmented facts as a matter of how to re-member them.
Like geography, the premodern indigenous conception of the past was
utterly different from-and displaced by-the Western notion of history.
This question, however, deserves a separate project. Our question remains
how the emergence of the geo-body was involved in the creation of Siam's
past. How has it generated or affected other knowledge or discourses _in order
to make them conform to the force and demand of the geo-body? Thts examination will give us a complex but illuminating example of how the conjuncture of two powerful discourses could happen and its results. In fact, a
demand for a completely new history emerged with the geo-body since the
latter was such a disruptive moment for the life of Siam. The formation of a
new kind of past was needed to mend the rupture in its continuity.

The Scar of 1893 and the Discontinuous Past
The French blockade of the Chao Phraya River by gunboats, even holding
the Siamese palace at gunpoint for days, was a shock to the Siamese elite. It
was hard for them to believe they could be defeated so easily. Besides, the
elite had an illusory trust in British support in the dispute with the French. In
the course of events, that confidence was broken and the British turned out
to be an unreliable ally. Britain never wanted to enter into serious conflict
with France on behalf of Siam and had informed Siam more than once that it
would not be "mixed up" with the incident. In reply to Siam's request on
the day of the blockade, therefore, London told Bangkok to "dispel any idea
that we are contemplating joint action to defend Bangkok." Worse than
expected, the British urged Siam to meet the French demand for the left bank
of the Mekhong, and when Siam hesitated they accused Siam of not being
cooperative. 1
Siam finally retreated. Confidence in its skillful diplomacy, its military
forces, and its natural right to the disputed territory diminished dramatically.
A historian puts it well when he says the 1893 incident became "a crisis of
morale" for the Siamese rulers:
[Siam's] sense of insecurity mounted, her self-respect cracked .... The king,
who had been ill throughout the crisis, suffered a physical and moral collapse.
He lost some forty-two pounds in weight between August and November and
openly declared his loss of interest in life. 2

Not many people thought that the king could survive. Jockeying for the
regency position to manage the throne for the young heir got under way. J
But ultimately the king did survive, due in large part to a critical but
inspiring poem by one of his brother-associates, Prince Damrong. 4 Not only
did he survive, but he also made a remarkable recovery as captain of the Ship
of Siam, as Damrong put it. He fortified the spirit of the ruling circle for the
tasks ahead.
But who could deny the observation that the king, and certainly others
too, "was permanently scarred by the 1893 crisis" ?5 To them it seemed that
Siam's independence was imminently threatened, more so indeed with every
passing year. The perceived "loss" of territories, the shock of mid-July 1893,
the sudden exposure and proof of the empire's failure, the disillusionment of
any unrealistic confidence in oneself and trust in civilized diplomacy, the crisis
of morale in the immediate months following the event-all amounted to
what has been recognized as a moment of deep agony in the history of Siam.
Certainly it was an agony for the Siamese rulers.

142

In this sense the 1893 crisis was a moment of great contradiction. It was
the time Siam lost many of its former tributaries to the French. Yet it was the
culminating moment of the emergence of the geo-body of Siam. It represented a sharp break in geographical concepts and practices and the displacement of the old notion of nationhood. Ostensibly, Siam was then in the process of modernization and the crisis appeared as an interruption of this
process. Yet no one could deny that the post-1893 Siam was not the same as
before, even in the minds of the rulers. They continued their tasks, but in a
different situation, and in a different Siam, both on the earth's surface and in
their own minds. The 1893 crisis marked a sharp discontinuity in the life of
Siam. This rupture in the life of the nation needed to be sewn together and
required appropriate accounts of the turbulence to mend it in order to reassure everyone that the life of the country was a continuous stream of time.
The demand for a new account at a time when there was tension in the
moments of continuity/discontinuity is not a new phenomenon. Nor was it
for Siam. Many studies have emphasized the role of historical writing as a
political instrument to legitimate new regimes against their rivals in a propagandistic or even an Orwellian sense. 6 Few studies, however, have analyzed
the relationship between a rupture and a reassuring account of the past that
emphasizes the continuity of the familiar or even the revival of golden days.
At the start of the Bangkok period in the late eighteenth century, for example, a new dynasty in a new palace at the new city-that is, a new microcosm
-tried to restore order following the collapse of the previous center. The
tension of the continuity/break was calmed by a religious account of the
reordered world and by the creation of the court's history which gave assurance of the continuity of the previous world order. 7 Given its distortions and
misplaced accounts, perhaps such writing was not so much a political device
to legitimize the new regime as an ideological one to help them come to
terms with their immediate past. Another rupture was the 1932 revolution
which ended the absolute monarchy and began the new Siam under military
regimes. This time the rupture was sutured, simply by suppressing the divisive nature of the event or leaving it out. Instead, the Thai past is framed as a
series of struggles to liberate the country from foreign rule or to defend its
independence, a familiar anticolonial theme. Moreover, post-1932 Siam is cast
as the revival of the golden age of Sukhothai, supposedly the first kingdom of
Siam. 8 In this scheme, despite vicissitudes in the life of the nation, the present
would witness a continuation of the good old days. Nothing was lost and
nothing would be unfamiliar in the nation's future life without the absolute
monarchy.
The turbulent times were never suppressed or erased from memory.

Ceo-Body and History

143

Rather, they were fully recognized but only to be shaped and explained in
such a way that the ruptures were accommodated to an enduring past. To
what extent, then, was the modern account of Siam's past affected by the
rupture of 1893? Could it have happened that, in order to dissolve the discontinuity, the emergence of the geo-body and the role of maps must be concealed? Was there any relationship between the post-1893 Siam, particularly
with the emergence of the geo-body, and the emergence of modern historical
writing in Siam? Let us look at how the story of the 1893 disruptive moment
has been depicted. The strategies that such a historiography employs may
indicate how the entire body of Siam's past has been constructed.

The Assumed Ceo-Body in the Thai Past
The first product of the conjuncture between the geo-body and history we
will consider is the historiography of that critical period. For Thai historians,
the last two decades of the nineteenth century have never been known for
the emergence of the geo-body. Rather, the period and the incident are
known as the loss of territories and the integration of provincial administration. Both were related but, in this view, were separate processes. And this
Thai view has been taken for granted by Western scholars. What are the
measures this conventional historiography has employed to produce such a
history, which certainly has effects on the remembrance of that disruptive
moment?
A typical account begins with the desire of French colonialism to occupy
Southeast Asia in order to counter the expanding influence of Britain in the
region and find a route to southern China, which was believed to be an economically profitable project. The problems started after France occupied
Vietnam and further claimed the left (east) bank of the Mekhong. Rang Sayamanonda, in one of his textbooks about Thailand in English, says that the
French had taken over Sipsong Chuthai and Huaphan from Siam in 1887, but
they were not yet satisfied. Rang depicts the unreasonable French aspiring to
the whole of Laos even though their own maps showed Laos as part of Siam.
The French had acted aggressively in various disputes along the borders.
They were consumed by greed. 9
A similar account of the unreasonable, greedy, untrustworthy French is
given by another prominent Thai historian, Khachorn Sukhabhanij. He says
that despite Siam's reasonable and sincere offers to settle the disputes peacefully, the French were evasive, procrastinating, and constantly lying. As the
next innocent victim, Siam was in jeopardy and had done its best merely to
protect itself from the predator. But when violence occurred, the French

144

Chapter Eight

complained that Siam had molested them along the borders for years and thus
deserved a proper retaliation. This was the way the French justified their
expansion, he explained. 10
Neither Rong nor Khachorn wrote a detailed history, but their supervision
of history graduate students bore many offspring: first they carefully work
out the details of the incident; once the view becomes conventional, it is
capable of reproducing without the presence of the progenitors. Many studies
share the same idea. We are told about France's wicked tactics, lies, and dishonesty to achieve its greedy and aggressive ends. Siam had done everything
possible to protect itself, including the reform of the administration to control its tributaries directly from Bangkok and the suppression of the Ho bandits in the disputed territories. Finally, without any reasonable motive but to
ensure its success, France resorted to gunboat diplomacy with which Siam
could not contend. In brief, it is a sad story of the devil defeating the virgin. 11
It goes without saying that every account argues that the whole left bank
of the Mekhong undoubtedly belonged to Siam. Wyatt, in the book now
becoming a standard text on Thai history in English, adopts the same view.
In sympathy with Siam, he argues, retrospectively, that the French had not a
single piece of evidence to support their claim, apart from the alleged protector status inherited from Vietnam. Regrettably, Siam should not have trusted
the British so much and was wrong in believing that "the French would
never sustain their ridiculous claims in a supposedly civilized world." 12 Here
is an apt summary with which all the conventional accounts would no doubt
unanimously agree:
In a real sense, Siam was being forced to agree to outrageous demands simply
because the kingdom had defended its own territories against foreign invasion. It
was as if a new government coming to power in Britain had revived the eighteenth-century claims to the United States, and then punished the American
government for resisting a British invasion sent to enforce those claims. 13

While Wyatt has opted for a fiction in Anglo-American history to capture
the theme of the whole incident, Khachorn has chosen one of Aesop's most
popular tales as his analogy: "We have seen clearly that France adopted the
ploys of the Wolf who, first, picks a quarrel with the Lamb, then jumps over
and executes it." 14 Does this analogy come out of the story? Or is it the other
way round? Has this famous tale in fact become a grid to make the confusing
story elements orderly, organized, intelligible, and familiar to the reader? To
what extent is the metaphor in fact the frame for conceptualizing this episode
of the past?
In Siam's view, the history of that moment was tragic. This is not because

Ceo-Body and History

145

the desire of the prime actor has not been fulfilled as in a Western tragedy,
but because in this episode of history the adharma (evil) was victorious over
the dharma (good). If this is so, which runs somewhat counter to Buddhist
rationality, the historiography of the reform will relieve the sense of loss and
irrationality.
The memory of such relief first appeared in the form of a personal recollection of Prince Damrong, who himself administered the reform between 1892
and 1915. Written in the early 1940s but unfinished at his death, Thesaphiban
reports that Chulalongkorn reminded Damrong of foreign threats to Siam at
the time and thus encouraged him to undertake the reform. If Siam did not
quickly tidy up its provincial administration but carelessly left it in such a
mess, the country would be in danger. Siam might lose its independence.ts
This theme was taken up a few decades later by Tej Bunnag, whose book
beca.me the authority for many later studies in Thailand about the reform. Tej
re~mds us of the legacy of Damrong by choosing to study only the period in
wh1c~ Da~rong was t~e interior minister. He subscribes to Damrong's perspectiVe faithfully, saymg that he wrote the book "in the belief that [the
reform of provincial administration] was one of the factors which helped
Siam survive as an independent nation in an age of the European imperialism." 16
Tej begins with a description of the administration before 1892. The pre1892 Siam was, in his words, "in theory" unified. Siam's sovereignty over
the outlying provinces and tributaries, thus its integrity, was never in doubt.
The potential problem lay, he argues, in the fact that until1892 such a theory
h~d not yet been properly implemented "in practice." 17 This theory/practice
d1screpancy became a dangerous condition only in the face of colonialism. In
January 1896, the king warned his commissioners over the former tributaries
that foreign powers were ready to use any "internal" conflict as a justification to intervene in Siam's affairs. They must protect Siam "against internal
and external dangers." 18 The tributaries were the weakest points and needed
reform if the country was to "defend" itself. Therefore the government centralizat~on was the key to the problem, Tej explains, despite much opposition
and resistance. The rest of the book proceeds to describe in detail how the
integrated administration was implemented in practice step-by-step throughout the country.
Tej's book provides the foundation for a number of later works by Thai
historians who simply apply the same idea to a particular area or specific
~spect of the reform, to an expanded period before and after Damrong's
mcumbency, or to the works of other princes. 19 The theme of foreign threats
-hence the necessity for a reform to "defend" the country-becomes a pre-

146

Chapter Eight

sumption, not a thesis. In many cases, it is even advanced at the beginning as
an undisputed fact if not a truth. In the conclusion, unsurprisingly, most
express relief and confidence. Thanks to the reform, Siam survived. For Tej,
Siam had passed one of the most difficult periods in its life with great success.
Siam reemerged more glorious than ever. It was not just a reform; it was a
glorious revolution: 20
[Prince Damrong] and the Thesaphiban system of provincial administration
had indeed helped to preserve the Thai kingdom as the only independent nation
of Southeast Asia in the age of European imperialism .... During that period
[1892-1915 under Damrong's incumbency], Siam was transformed from a conglomeration of states and provinces without clearly defined boundaries to a
compact state with a definite frontier. The foundations were laid for a modern
central administration and a centralized provincial administration. A start was
made in the development of economy. The people were emancipated from a semivassalage and slavery and initiated in self-government . ... [The reform) generated
dynamic forces which are still shaping modern Thailand. 21

In both the stories of the loss of territories and the reform, European imperialism, particularly French imperialism, takes on the role of the Wolf. Siam
is the Lamb whose survival was at risk amidst a situation in which its neighbors had already fallen. Standing alone, Siam protected itself gracefully, reasonably, and wisely. In one story, the end is rather tragic, but only because
the Wolf was beyond Siam's capability to deal with reasonably. In the other
story, the end is a happy one. Not only did Siam defend itself, but it survived
with a great leap forward.
Both the loss of territories and the reform appear to be the consequence of
the same cause-the external threat-which became the only thread uniting
the two stories. They transmit the same message: the external danger and the
need for defense or sacrifice. They appear as a two-sided outcome of the same
moment in the past. Subconsciously kept together in our memory, they form
a binary discourse of the same episode which generates a number of nationalist historical discourses. Of course, they never appear as the two operations in
the contest for the exclusive margins which led to the emergence of the geobody. In fact, some studies say a lot about mapping and something about
multiple submission. Tej also mentions the absence of modern boundaries as
one of the problems of the pre-1892 administration. But mapping and the
boundary problem were merely technical issues that played no significant role
in either the cause or its resolution.
Considered closely, these two stories rely on a number of common assumptions without which the stories would be read and remembered differently. I

Ceo-Body and History

147

call these assumptions "strategies," since they were not simply ineffectual
ideas. Rather, they have command functions by which the stories must be
organized or rearranged accordingly in order to produce the proper plot
and to sustain certain desired meanings and values, both intellectually and
emotionally.
The first strategy is to assume the prior existence of the geo-body of Siam.
All the accounts about the loss of territories must establish that the geo-body
of Siam was always there and extended well beyond the left bank of the
Mekhong. There was no fundamental difference between the indigenous and
the modern kinds of political space and interstate relations. Hence there was
no ambiguity of space. Without this assumption, there would be no ground
for agony because there could not have been any "loss." In the history of the
reform, this strategy is even more necessary for the justification of direct control by Bangkok. Without it, Siam's attempts to control the disputed territories would be seen as anything but self-defense, and its actions to quell the
former tributaries anything but internal affairs. The command function of
this strategy is to prevent any "improper" interpretation which may point at
Siam's expansion, conquest, or even contest. The assumed geo-body helps
control the ideas of internal/ external and defense. This strategy, furthermore, leads to the view, now taken for granted, which considers the whole
question from Bangkok's perspective, another strategy we shall consider
shortly. This means the suppression of the perspectives of tiny states in the
region. Above all, the prior existence of the geo-body, at least "in theory,"
directly prevents any recollection that it was in the process of being created.
The role of mapping as its precedent is thereby concealed. In doing so, the
nature of the rupture is fundamentally changed. The moments no longer
involve a struggle to eradicate the ambiguity of space. The moments become
a critical time merely to preserve the existing integrity and implement the
unified geo-body and exclusive sovereignty.
The second strategy is to establish the stories within the context of modern
international politics, particularly colonialism. First of all, this context commands the story to be perceived in terms of the relations between Siam-an
integrated nation-state-and the Western powers. The international context
imposes a grid to reduce, classify, or exclude the voice of those tiny states
which were never born later as nations, despite their active role at that time,
and allows only the story of the emerging nation to be heard. It is the context of the event as seen from the metropoles only. From a local perspective,
it is a misplaced and anachronistic context.
Seen against a different context, the role of Siam in relation to foreign
nations would differ. Within the local context of hierarchical powers with-

148

Chapter Eight

out the geo-body, they were rival expansionists contesting for the same prey,
albeit with unequal capabilities. Within the global context of international
politics of the colonial era, however, the conflicts became unfair disputes
between the world superpowers and a remote nation in self-defense. The
anti-imperialist outlook, proudly adopted by many historians of the postcolonial era, alters the terms of these relations. Siam in this global reference was
no longer a contestant, a hegemonic force, or an indigenous expansionist. It
became a Lamb instead of a Lesser Wolf. What should be a history of
regional hegemonism turns out to be a glorious anticolonial history performed by the Siamese elite. The threat from the immoral power has become
a famous cause of whatever Siam did in that period, making Siam's actions a
just struggle for its "survival."
The third and final strategy is to take Bangkok's point of view. In the context set by the previous strategy, it seems proper, politically correct, hence
justified, for a good historian to take Bangkok's side. The agonies of the tiny
states, their voices, and their interests are overlooked or suppressed, as if they
were the inevitable cost of security. The conquests by the Siamese force and
the implementation of the centralized regime have been celebrated as proud
accomplishments. As Tej puts it in the quotation cited above, people were
emancipated and self-government was initiated. Whose self-government?
Who was emancipated from whom?
Indeed, if we merely change our point of view, the entire story about the
administrative reform and the battle against the Ho reads very much like a
colonial history in which Siam always claimed its natural superiority over the
regional horizon. Because of this, the function of the external threat as the
causality of the stories is vital for the history of Siam. Not only can this element alter the contextual reference as suggested. It can also shift Bangkok's
perspective from a view toward its victims to another view toward the external powers. The shifting perspective conceals the expansionist desire but
magnifies the anticolonial pretension.
This has been the perspective of most historians on the modernization of
Siam. They admire, glorify, celebrate the ability to retain Lanna and some of
the Malay states, including the suppression of the resistance against
Bangkok's centralization, such as the rebellions in 1902. 22 The local resistance
was, seen from Bangkok, trouble for "national" survival; hence the occasional subjugation of tributaries was necessary for "internal" stability. Furthermore, the agony of the Siamese rulers in Bangkok-a result of the defeat
in the contest and the shock of mid-July 1893-became a national agony
which has created a common sentiment among Thai against foreign threats.
In many cases, moreover, the elitist nationalist blindness takes another toll:

T

Geo-Body and History

149

the evaluation of the sources. For generations, from Khachorn to his students, the studies of this issue have relied on the map and the article by
George Curzon, as mentioned earlier, as their authoritative evidence retrospectively against the French claim. Khachorn even praises Lord Curzon as
one who was familiar with Siam and thus his article must be a reliable source.
As we may guess, McCarthy is among those who are classified as eminently
reliable. 23 In fact, in his article Curzon stated clearly that he did not want to
see the French move further westward since it would jeopardize British
Burma and Malaya. But he strongly opposed any British involvement in the
Franco-Siamese dispute. Nowhere in the article did he support Siam's claim.
George Nathaniel Curzon was a renowned colonialist who later became viceroy of British India, but he might not have known much about Siam. As
Edward Said describes him,
Lord Curzon ... always spoke the imperial lingua franca, and more obtrusively even than Cromer he delineated the relationship between Britain and the
Orient in terms of possession, in terms of a large geographical space wholly
owned by an efficient colonial master. For him, ... the empire was not an
"object of ambition" but "first and foremost, a great historical and political
and sociological fact." 24

It appears that the national agony has been perpetuated by historians themselves to the extent that it works blindly in repudiating the French in the
past. 25 Their basic criterion of reliability is simply who took which side in the
conflict. In this regard, even though it is now a century after Siam's trust in
the British alliance turned sour, it seems that these historians still play the
same game with a similar tactic of relying on the authority of British colonialism to rally against the French.
In brief, the conventional history of the loss of territories and provincial
reform can exist only if the ideas of premodern hierarchical polity and the
nonbounded realm are suspended or suppressed. Then the whole scenario is
read in the light of the modern concept of international relations and the
vision of modern territorial states with boundaries and exclusive and absolute
sovereignty. The agony is also concrete, identified by signs of the new conceptions such as territories that were "lost." All of these strategies have
arranged the recollection of that critical moment of Siam's biography for a
certain desired effect. Perhaps the most significant result is that the moment
becomes almost identical to the anticolonial or nationalist past of neighboring
countries. And the glorious survival and successful reform are attributed to
the intelligence of monarchs and prince-rulers. All of them become national
saviors. 26 This kind of history is capable of turning the rupture into continu-

Chapter Eight

150

ity and the proud accomplishment of the monarchs, the familiar theme in
Thai historical consciousness.

Historical Atlas
If the agony of defeat by a European power has scarred Thai memory up to
the present day, there is no doubt that half a century after the disruptive
moment such a memory was firmly marked in the minds of the Siamese elite
of that generation. After the 1932 revolution which overthrew the absolute
monarchy, however, the wound was not that of the royal dignity but was
transferred to the nationhood. The monument to that agony was the "lost"
territories themselves. The issue of the lost territories was raised from time to
time in many writings until it became high on the national agenda again in
the late 1930s.2' In the absence of the monarchy, which abdicated in 1935,
the regimes after 1932 had to build up legitimacy and credibility. Following
the global current of fascism, the Phibun government (1939-1944) espoused
the chauvinistic notion of the Thai civilized nation. They changed the name
of the country to "Thailand" in May 1939. 28 Many nationalist ideas and
practices proliferated under the guidance of the government which stipulated
cultural and economic norms of behavior from the public level to the family
and the individual. 29
In politics the government propagated the notion of the great Thai race
and the brotherhood ofTai peoples in mainland Southeast Asia. Moreover, to
rally popular support they promoted the movement calling for the return of
the lost territories. Their commitment to "recover" the lost territories, especially the right bank of the Mekhong handed over to the French by the treaties in 1904 and 1907, was so significant to the Phibun government that its
reputation was at risk after the Vichy government had rejected the request in
1940. To avoid a political catastrophe, the government decided to cooperate
with the Japanese in 1940 in return for the latter's powerful support in the
international community. This led to military cooperation in December
1941, and in return Thailand was given the western part of Cambodia, a
temporary possession which lasted only until the end of the war. 30
It was during this situation that a map titled Phaenthi prawat-anakhet-thai
(Map of the History of Thailand's Boundary) was produced and became
influential (see Figure 13). 31 The map assumes that the extent of Siam's
bounded territory before any loss is the total legitimate realm of Siam. It is
not clear, however, where this legitimate extent came from. The history of
the boundaries accounts for those losses of territories which reduced the legitimate realm until the present boundary of Siam came about. But there are

T

Ceo-Body and History

151

many versions of the losses. In the popular version shown here, each loss was
marked by different colors with the numbers 1 to 8 assigned to each of the
eight losses:
1. Penang and Wellesley were ceded to Britain during 1786-1800.
2. Tavoy, Mergui, and Tenasserim were taken by Burma in 1793.
3. Most of Cambodia was ceded to France in 1867, except the western part which
became the Eastern Province of Siam until loss no. 7.
4. Sipsong Chuthai were occupied by France in 1888.
5. Laos of the left bank of the Mekhong was ceded to France in 1893.
6. The Lao regions on the right bank of the Mekhong, opposite Luang Phrabang
and Champasak, were ceded to France in 1904.
7. The western part of Cambodia (Siamreap, Sisophon, and Battambang) were
ceded to France in 1907.
8. Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu were ceded to Britain in 1909.

Most of the losses accounted for in this map were surrendered to European
powers from the late nineteenth century, except for the first and second,
which happened a century earlier (and the second was taken by Siam's traditional arch-rival). But the 1935 version of this map accounted for only seven
losses. In many writings about the issue, the number and areas of losses are
varied. Some omit the fourth loss on this map, suggesting that it never
belonged to Siam. Many omit the first two or three since they took place in
different contexts from the rest. One includes Singapore, Malacca, andJahore
among the losses. Some add the Shan states and Sipsong Panna to the list of
losses while failing to mention Sipsong Chuthai. 32 Besides, none of them
mentions Chiangmai's cession in 1834 and Bangkok's cession in 1892, both
to the British.
Likewise, Western scholars on the issue present a similar situation. The
losses they account for are varied, and their maps are anything but uniform.
Minton Goldman does not consider Sipsong Chuthai as a loss, for example,
and includes Huaphan as part of French Indochina even before 1893.33 Most
Thai scholars would not agree with him. Wyatt, on the other hand, follows
the 1940 Thai map closely. But the territory lost in 1888 to the French
appears larger than in any other version, even the Thai maps, while he does
not include the loss to Burma in his map. The total legitimate realm before
any loss in his map therefore differs from the Thai prototype. In the Thai
map, the total realm before a loss includes the Mon region of Lower Burma
but excludes Sipsong Panna. In Wyatt's map, it includes the huge Sipsong
Panna but excludes the Mon. 34
This kind of map is generally supposed to be a representation of the territory of Siam before and after the losses. But, as we have seen, it is impossible

152

Chapter Eight

to figure out exactly what was Siam before the loss or even whether there
was really a loss of territory. By what means can a historian establish a legitimate realm, with all modern geographical conventions, before the end of the
nineteenth century in order to identify or talk about the loss? How can any
of these studies say with authority which parts counted or did not count as
Siam's realm and hence which constituted a loss or not?
As it happens, there are several versions of the presupposed legitimate
realm. None of them ever explains why they propose it as such; all of them
dodge that question to identify the deductions from that total realm. But if
the total territory before any loss is logically speculative, the loss of territory
is, at best, also a logical speculation imposed by the agonized elite onto the
populace in order to communicate the same emotion. The map is merely a
creation out of the two fundamental elements: an elitist memory of the crisis
and the modern geo-body of Siam. Based on the perception provided by the
former, the map is in fact a retrospective projection of the present geo-body
of Siam. The result is twofold: first, a geo-body which had never existed in
the past was realized by historical projection; second, the agony is visually
codified by a map. Now the anguish is concrete, measurable, and easily transmittable.
This map is in no way a scientific record of any geographic reality outside
itself. It is a visual text of a historical proposition, a codification of the crisis,
indeed a purely semiotic manufacture. The theme of this map is not how
Siam was created but how Siam's present axe shape came about. It does not
hesitate to tell its own history-which not only cleverly rejects the existence
of anything like Bangkok expansionism but also refutes any view that Siam
was delimited for the first time by the European powers. If the greater,
homogeneously bounded Siam had existed long before, the numerous incidents vividly show Siam's cruel and irrational enemies forced it to sacrifice its
body time after time. Sometimes the losses are calculated in square kilometers
-as if to quantify the amount of suffering-which is nearly half the legitimate body. The map seems to say, nonetheless, that despite that amount
of agony, the most important task is to preserve independence. And Siam
survived.
In 1940 this map was distributed to schools and government offices
throughout the country. The British consul regarded this as a gesture of, as
he put it, Siamese "imperialism" that wished to encroach upon the left bank
of the Mekhong, Lower Burma, and the four Malay states. He and the
French charge d'affaires protested. 35 The Ministry of Defense, which was
responsible for the publication, explained it away, saying that it was used
exclusively for historical study. But later it was used in the movement calling

Ceo-Body and History

153

for the return of territory from the French. The British were alarmed that the
movement might demand the territory taken by them too. 36 Phibun gave his
word to the consul that such would not be the case, and he would stop the
distribution of the map. But one of Phibun's close advisors who was said to
be the most pro-Japanese figure in the government had it published again and
sold at the price of one-tenth of a baht per copy. 37 Again, the government
denied any involvement in its publication and ordered its sale to be stopped.
Even now, the map is still easily found in school textbooks and most Thai
atlases. Owing to a new situation after World War II and the postcolonial
era, the map has lost its immediate political thrust. But its function as a sentimental visual code of history persists. Its power over the discourse of the
nation's biography has not been diminished.
Another set of powerful historical maps covers not a single episode of crisis
but the entire scheme of Thai history. Produced in 1935-1936 by the Royal
Survey Department under the Ministry of Defense, the maps show Thai historical kingdoms from the eighth century up to the early Bangkok period, as
well as the movement of the Thai peoples since the first millennium (see Figures 14 to 19). 38 Sternstein calls this set of maps "The Historical Atlas of
Thailand." 39 Like the Map of the History of Thailand's Boundary, this historical atlas is very well known in Thai textbooks and atlases.
The title of the set in different editions varies slightly. Thongbai's atlas,
the most popular one in Thai since 1963, emphasizes the word "Thai" in the
title of every map, while the 1935-1936 originals did not. Each map is
designed to show specifically only the Thai "Kingdom of ... in the Reign
of ..." 40 The following list gives the translated title of each map appearing
in Thongbai's atlas:
Considering this atlas as "the most comprehensive and accurate account of
the number, location, and status of centers known to have been in existence
during several important periods prior to the nineteenth century," Sternstein

154

nonetheless points out a number of errors and shortcomings. 43 He also correctly comments that the maps do not show the complication of hierarchical
status of centers within the realm. But how can a modern map do that? The
function of a modern map to suppress the indigenous space has never been an
issue. On the contrary, the ability of modern geographic technology to
invent the space of the past, to control it, and then to put it on paper has been
praised. Sternstein even joins the attempt to pinpoint the precise delimitation
of these kingdoms.
The question is this: how does this atlas create emotional effects and shape
our memory? First of all, it goes without saying that there are at least two
basic requisites that make these maps intelligible: the historical knowledge
needed to understand what these maps are about and the knowledge of how
to read a map. But, like the Map of the History of Thailand's Boundary,
these maps have no direct relation to Siam on the earth's surface. As a visual
coding of historical knowledge, they are retrospective speculations based on
the present geo-body of Siam. If one had never seen the present map of Siam,
these historical maps would not make any sense. But if one has in fact seen
Siam's map, even without any travel beyond a few miles from home, or even
as a foreign student who never visits Thailand but has read Wyatt's book,
one easily receives the message of these maps. The origin of these historical
maps is not the remote past as it is purported to be. The origin is the geobody of Siam in the present.
According to these historical maps, the geo-body is not a modern creation.
The maps reject any idea that the Thai nationhood was conceived only in the
recent past as a result of the intercourse between the old Siam and Western
powers. Likewise, the notion that modern Siam is the result of ruptures, not
continuity, is precluded. The disruptive moments are tamed and endurable. It
is ironic that the recent birth of the geo-body and nationhood was suppressed
by a map, the same technology which gave them birth. As the humble origin
of the geo-body in the operation of mapping is concealed, the geo-body of
nationhood becomes naturalized as having existed with the Thai since time
immemorial.
It appears that the operational domain of the mapping discourse extends far
beyond the knowledge of space and enters our memory as well. In fact, it is
through this mediation of historical maps that the domains of space and
memory, with knowledge and sentiments, are transgressed. Commenting on
how a Thai historical play can produce such an emotional effect, a historian
has suggested one method: "The term prathetthai [Thailand], for example,
was used for Sukhothai and Ayudhya regardless of its anachronism. [This]
was done purposefully in order to blur the time span, so that the past could

Geo-Body and History

155

be lifted out of its context, reshaped to suit the author's needs, and presented
to the audience to cause particular sentimental effects." 44
The function of the geo-body of Siam's past in historical maps is the same
as the term prathetthai here. Anachronistic devices make the past familiar to
the present-hence the possibility of transfering values, emotions, and other
meanings, particularly patriotism and chauvinism, from the present back to
the past and thus into our memory. Without anachronism, plays and historical maps are doomed to fail. The geo-body in the historical maps has a similar
function. It provides a channel, an access, and an opportunity to expropriate
the past in the light of present needs. As an anachronistic device, in short, the
geo-body helps to represent the continuity of Thai history despite its historic
effect as, ironically, a disruption of that continuity. It mediates a continuum
of the life of the nation.
What else, apart from the mediating function of the geo-body, makes this
historical atlas effective in shaping the perception of the Thai past? It is quite
true that the maps represent only the period of the Thai ascendancy in the
region. The atlas neither indicates the fluctuations of the domains and power
in the intervals, nor does it constitute a true historical sequence of the
regional politics. 45 But such is its strength, not its shortcoming. The atlas is
so selective that it is able to highlight Siam's biography by demonstrating the
movements and growth of its body-thus the nationhood-from the beginning to the present within seven frames (six historical maps plus the History
of Thailand's Boundary map). The maps tell us the story, beginning in the
childhood of the nation, of how the Thai were forced by a foreign threat, the
Chinese, to emigrate southward where they believed the golden destination
was teleologically placed. The migrations signify hardship as well as love for
independence since time immemorial. Eventually the Thai arrived at the
Golden Peninsula where the Khmer had occupied most of the land. Again,
despite hardship under foreign domination, independence was in the Thai
heart-hence the struggle to establish a great kingdom of their own until
their coming-of-age was achieved at Sukhothai. Throughout hundreds of
years in this setting, however, Thai kingdoms faced foreign threats from time
to time, especially from the Burmese. The highlighted periods show that at
these turbulent times the heroic kings always led the Thai people to fight
back to restore the country. Indeed, each time Siam was consolidated, its
power was greater than ever. Despite hardship and foreign enemies, Siam
was great and prosperous. The atlas makes the nation's past alive. All the
maps operate as a single set of visual codes, not individually. Operating
together, they represent the entire plot of Thai history.
Another emotional effect which can be visualized in these maps is the gran-

Chapter Eight

156

deur of Siam. One cannot help noticing how great Siam's body was in the
past in comparison with its neighbors. The maps help one imagine the good
old days when Laos, the Malay states, parts of southern China, the Shan
states, and the whole of Cambodia as well as Lanna were integral parts of
Siam. So great was it that the historical arch-rivals, Burma and Vietnam,
look humbler on every map. This signifies the efforts of the ancestors to
establish and preserve the nation and to ensure its progress up to the present
time.
The maps are not for a study of historical geography, but for historical
consciousness about the life of the nation. Data and facts are necessary to
make them look realistic and objective. What is the value of producing a map
of, say, 1569-1584 when Ayudhya was defeated and Siam was said to have
lost its independence? If such a period were visualized in the same fashion as
this atlas, Siam would appear in the same color as Burma on the same map,
with Ayudhya integrated into the Burmese kingdom. What is the value of
publishing a map of, say, the fifteenth century when Lanna was independent
and fought against Ayudhya to control Sukhothai? These two "if" maps
would confuse or destroy the ideology for which the whole set is designed.

The Past Plotted
It appears that the conceptual strategies and literary techniques constructed
around the deployment of the geo-body are crucial in both the historiography
of the 1893 crisis and the historical atlas. They command the presumptions
and perspective as well as create the desired sentimental effects to tame the
disruptive moment in the life of the nationhood and, in turn, produce an
anticolonial biography of which the nation can be proud.
As many thinkers now argue, the past, historical narrative, and literary
construct are not quite separate realms. Not only are anachronism and selective emphasis responsible for the desired effects, but the arrangement of the
story elements in the historiography and atlas has also produced a particular
way of recollecting the past. Astonishingly, a closer look at the arrangement
-the plot-of the history of the 1893 crisis and the atlas will find that they
resemble a typical plot of popular Thai historical fictions and plays.
Luang Wichitwathakan (Luang Wichit) (1898-1962) was the most influential and the most prolific creator of nationalist cultural works in Thailand
-an exponent of the powerful nationalist historiography, a novelist of many
historical fictions, a renowned playwright of historical plays, and writer of
many well-known militaristic songs. 46 A brief examination of his plays is perhaps the best way to understand the relationship between literary techniques

Ceo-Body and History

157

and Thai history. The themes of Luang Wichit's plays are quite limited: the
orig_in of Thai people, the establishment of the Thai kingdoms, the struggle
for mdependence, the battle against foreign enemies, and the unification of
the Thai nation. Only a few are about the impermanence of life, all of which
were written in the sudden decline of his official career after World War II.
Within these themes, despite the various complexities of the story, the plot is
generally the same: the peaceful nation beset by foreign enemies, actions
attempted to solve the problem, then the celebrated resolution. In Hayden
White's scheme, it is a comedy plot. In my perspective, it is a familiar Thai
melodrama.
An example of this typical plot will be helpful. Luang Wichit's first historical play, "King Naresuan Declares Independence," performed for the first
time in 1934, is the story of a heroic Thai king in the late sixteenth century.
The story starts with a narration and an opening dialogue between Naresuan
and a noble about the suffering the Thai people have faced since the country
was defeated by Burma fifteen years earlier. Seeking revenge, they are now
looking for an opportunity to restore the country's independence and, in one
particular phrase, to recover the realm (dindaen): "We must recover our independence. Independence is the heart of our life. For any prathet without independence, people of that prathet are not human."47
The opportunity came when Nandabayin, the Burmese king, ordered
Ayudhya to send a troop to help him fight a rebel at Ava in 1584. But when
the troop reached Khraeng, a Mon town near the border, the two Mon commanders who received the order from Nandabayin to ambush Naresuan
changed their minds and defected to the Thai side. Charging the Burmese
king with dishonesty and conspiring to assassinate him, Naresuan then performed a ritual declaring the independence of Ayudhya. After that, the Mon
people there voluntarily joined him to attack the Burmese capital at Pegu. 48
The play resumes at the final episode, one of the most fabulous stories in Thai
history. According to the play all Thai and Mon people under Naresuan's
leadership crossed a river on their way back from Pegu without a single casualty, but a Burmese troop followed closely. Naresuan then fired a single shot
across the river and miraculously struck the Burmese commander dead. 49
Naresuan finally made a prophecy that his soul would look after the country
forever; but the Thai people must follow his example in bravery, sacrifice,
and never-ending effort against the enemy.
The play's story follows the Thai chronicles closely. For a more complex
story, there may be more actions and, of course, more problems or conflicts
added to the major plot. But the additions are always problems at another
level, mostly individual issues such as gratitude, personal animosity, and, the

158

Chapter Eight

most popular choice, love. The different levels of problems generate more
complex actions and plot. In most cases the individual interest will eventually
conflict with the national interest. For a nationalist, of course, the former is
always secondary to, and must be sacrificed for, the latter. Furthermore, in
the introduction to each story the problem always anticipates a desirable end,
such as the liberation of the country, which is always accomplished. Besides,
many plays end with the sacrifice or death of the hero, which makes the story
more sentimental. Even so, such an end is far from tragic because it is a sacrifice for a noble cause. Sacrifice and preparation for hardship, not complacency, are the message to the audience. The conflict between individual and
national interests has a similar function. The sacrifice of individual interest is
50
very sentimental, either sad or exciting, and is the climax of many plays.
The strategic plot is not an explanatory or logical expression, but a very emotional one which already subsumes all necessary explanations and reasons. In
many cases, especially between lovers, Luang Wichit cleverly uses dialogue to
resolve the conflicts with reason and not without sentiment-for example, he
plays with the word rak (love), which is part of the word for patriotism in
Thai, rakchat ("love the nation")Y His audience will be stimulated to think
and feel the rakchat through the sacrifice of the personal rak of the lovers.
Luang Wichit once admitted that historical plays are not history.
Although they must be based on history, they are colored, embellished, or
even invented stories to create particular effects. 52 Some of them should not
even be called "historical" plays (lakonprawattisat), since their only link to history is a name or an event as background for the story. Characters are usually
flat, one-sided, portrayed in black and white, and predictable. Dialogue is not
natural, and is sometimes like a written statement. Yet what is upheld as historical in these plays is not the invented story or character, but the messages
transmitted by the themes and plots.
Modern historical writing in Siam has never been considered akin to literary and fictive works. How does the historiography of the loss of territories
and the reform of provincial administration make use of the strategies and
techniques of fiction? For one thing, it uses perspective to approach the story
from a particular viewpoint. Just as in fiction, this creates effects such as the
exaggeration and detraction of certain characters. With the contextual discourse of international politics, actors are classified and the two major characters, Siam and Imperialism, are distinguished. Accordingly, conflicts and
problems are classified into various levels of unequal value, importance, implications, and priority of concerns, such as external and internal, international
and domestic, national and individual. Sentimental attachment is induced
according to the classification of the conflicting interests. Therefore, a sacri-

Ceo-Body and History

159

fice of lovers or individual interest for the national interest is celebrated-like
the celebrated suppression of former tributary status for "emancipation" and
"self-government" when the nation's independence was endangered from
the "outside."
The historiography and maps discussed in this chapter use anachronistic
assumptions and devices such as the geo-body, boundary lines, the modern
concept of independence, and so on, similar to the anachronistic words and
dialogue in Luang Wichit's dramas. By this method they make the stories
intelligible and familiar to the present audience. By doing so, the transmission of values, ideas, and sentiment is possible. Furthermore, to generate
values out of the past, the two major characters in the primary conflict are
relatively flat, and presented in black and white, to the extent that one of
Aesop's fables about good versus evil is applicable. In the historical maps, the
technique of highlighting is necessary. If all the maps are put in the proper
order, with the map of the ancestral movement serving as the introduction to
Thai history, followed by the maps of the heroic periods, and the Map of the
History of Thailand's Boundary serving as the immediate episode before the
present, the course of Thai history becomes the development of the Thai territorial states.
Now apart from these strategies and techniques, the plots of the historiography, the maps, and Luang Wichit's plays are strikingly similar. The stories
always arise from the major conflict between Siam and foreign enemies. From
that point on, actions ensue. There can be additional conflicts, all of which
are subordinate to the major one, and more actions complexly interwoven
around the core of the major conflict. The story of administrative reform has
at its climax the successful implementation of the new system in former tributaries. It has a happy ending in which we see the expansion of the new system throughout the country and praise for the accomplishments of the
prince-administrators. In the story of the loss of territories, of course, the climax is the 1893 crisis. The story is rather tragic. Yet as Luang Wichit realized, sacrifice is a blessing in disguise. As long as the country's eventual survival and independence are known, it is not tragedy or complacency that
comes to mind. The story reminds us of hardship, sacrifice, and the necessity
of patriotism and unity. And these values will come across to us in a very
stimulating and moving fashion. For the historical atlas, although it contains
multiple episodes of Thai history, the plot is similar and the values are the
same. It is not a collection of unrelated maps. The whole set is a synopsis of
the entire history of Siam, comprehensively saying that throughout the life
of the nation the major problem has always been the danger from outside:
foreign enemies, external threats, the Chinese, the Khmer, the Burmese, the

Chapter Eight

160

French, the Wolf, or whatever. External enemies are recurrent and imminent. This is a repetitive motif from the early episode up to the pres~nt. The
orderly sequence of these repetitive motifs becomes the "master plot for the
entire biography of the nation up to the present time."
This master plot contains two somewhat paradoxical subplots. On the one
hand, it demonstrates development, change, or progress during the course of
the nation's life. On the other hand, the motif of external threat and the
struggle for independence is repetitive. The seemingly dynamic history is just
a recurring phenomenon. The repetitive theme seems redundant. Yet redu~­
dancy has an important function in our memory. As Edmund Leach notes m
his study of the Genesis myth,
in the mind of the believer, ... the redundancy of myth is a very reassuring
fact. Any particular myth in isolation is like a coded message body snarle~ up
with noisy interference. Even the most confident devotee might feel a httle
uncertain as to what precisely is being said. But as a result of r~dunda~cy, the
believer can feel that, even when the details vary, each alternative vers10n of a
myth confirms his understanding and reinforces the essential meaning of all the
others. 53

Nonetheless, both subplots complement each ot_her, and to~eth~r ~hey ~or­
mulate the master plot which accounts for the entire past of S1am s hfe. S1am
grows up, moving ahead, while the essential meaning of the life of t~e country-independence-is reinforced. Accord~ng to th~s master plot, S1am h~s
lived through many turbulent periods, facmg enem1es, threats, the hardsh1p
of migration, defeat, disunity, and so on. But Siam survives. The ago~y at
the end of the nineteenth century was nothing but another turbulent ep1sode
in which Siam's freedom was at risk. Thanks to the monarchs and Siam's love
of independence, the country survived yet again. Biogra~hically, the body ~f
the country has survived different phases and sometimes endured tra~1c
wounds. The sacrifice of the body around the turn of the century was cruc1al
for survival, however. And the fact is that Siam did prosper again. This time
the nation was even more progressive and more civilized. If the emergence of
the geo-body and the 1893 crisis constituted an acutely d~sruptive moment
for the life of Siam, a historiography of the kind we have d1scussed ~o ~ar ~as
performed a special function in reestablishing continuity of the natiOn s hfe.
There is no rupture, no break, no displacement. It has been concealed or
erased from our memory. Rather than being a critical disruption, th~ turbulent times even serve to stimulate unity behind the nation's leadership, espe.

Geo-Body and History

161

inexhaustible reservoir for Luang Wichit's fictional histories. For the history
of the loss of territories and the reform, the master plot provides the preconception, the given plot, necessary to understand the late-nineteenth-century
crisis as a recurring phenomenon similar to previous crises, only with different story elements, actions, characters, and dialogue.
Does the premodern literature about the past, on which modern history
relies, really contain such a master plot? Or is it the reading of the premodern
narrative by a modern mind?

The Past Remade
The preceding question leads us to another set of questions of even greater
importance. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the modern
historical study emerged in Siam. The pioneering scholars in the field introduced new methods and new concepts for reconstructing the past. Like geography and other disciplines, the new kind of past, though ostensibly based on
traditional texts, represented a sharp break from the indigenous notion. Did
the rupture at the end of the nineteenth century have any effect on this formulation of the new kind of past? If the experience of a few decades around
the turn of the century was so traumatic in the minds of the Siamese rulers,
did that terrible moment shape their preconception about the country's fate
both in their present and the past? Was the new past inscribed, directed, and
plotted by new ways of thinking and a new sentiment after that moment? Is
it possible that the master plot of the history of Siam as we know it today
was a result of the post-1893 trauma?
So far I have argued that the emergence of the geo-body demanded a new
history to seal the rupture in the life of the nation. The historiography of that
crisis has performed that function well. Although the writing on the loss of
territories and the provincial reforms was reconstructed much later, it is
likely that the crisis itself and the memory of it helped generate a new past of
Siam. In other words, the impact of the geo-body's emergence was so great
that Siam's past had to be completely remade in a new light. To a large
degree, the new history was remade by the discourse of the geo-body and its
associated conceptions and practices-for instance, the anachronistic assumption about the prior body and homogeneity, the necessarily misplaced context
of international politics, the concept of exclusive sovereignty of a state, and
above all the use of maps. The "misrepresented" history of the loss of territories and the reform, as well as the anachronistic maps, have done much to
create and perpetuate the new discourse of the Thai past with its new plot,
preconceptions, values, and techniques. This new discourse has been repro-

1
162

Chapter Eight

duced by media, schools, and many other institutions of ideology. It is predominant.
Given its important role in the creation of a new kind of past for Siam, the
discourse of the geo-body should have generated or shaped many other
aspects of the new history. The instance I wish to discuss here is the scope of
the new past: its subject. The question is: which past was worth accounting
for? On 2 December 1907, King Chulalongkorn gave a speech for the inauguration of the Antiquarian Society-known in Thai as Borankhadi Samoson
-which was a landmark of historical scholarship in Siam. The content of the
speech clearly represented the new discourse of Siam's past. The king urged
members of the society to study the past of the prathetchat (nation) as distinguished from the traditional chronicles of kingship, known as phongsawadan.
The prathetchat in his view, moreover, was not merely the realms of Ayudhya
and Bangkok but also included other major cities in prathetsayam (Siam):
The history should begin with Muang Luang, or some call it Hang or Chang,
which was the site of Thai people originally, followed by Chiang Saen,
Chiangrai, Chiangmai, Sawankhalok, Sokkhothai [Sukhothai], the old Ayudhya, the new Ayudhya, Lawo, Lopburi, Nakhonchaisi, Nakhonsithammarat,
or those muang [cities] which ruled over other muang like Kamphaengphet,
Chainat, Phitsanulok, San, Suphan, Kanchanaburi, Phetchaburi, for instance.
All of them had been powerful at times and made up the unified prathetsayam
[Siam] of today. 54

The space of the new history was obviously set by the recently emerging geobody. Indeed the geo-body was the only logical reason why those towns or
cities should be included in his scheme. Nor should the new history be confined to the time set by the royal chronicles. The temporal span of the new
history should be a thousand years, he suggested.
With this polycentric perception of the past, many histories of regional
centers were collected and written. But the following generation of historians-especially his son, Vajiravudh, and Prince Damrong-altered Chulalongkorn's spatiotemporal parameter. The new scheme, which went unchallenged until the 1980s, focused more on the histories of the great centers,
namely Sukhothai, Ayudhya, and Bangkok. The influence of the discourse of
the geo-body was still obvious, however. The focus on capitals and the
absence of other major cities did not mean that the space of the new history
was fragmented as in traditional time. Rather, by the early twentieth century
the unified country was represented by its center (hence the representation of
a country by referring to its capital or even the residence of its leader). Indeed
the idea of a capital in this new historiography implies awareness of the inte-

Ceo-Body and History

163

grated geo-body. In fact, Sukhothai has been regarded as the first capital of
S~am because it is believed to have ruled over most of the present territory of
Starn and beyond whereas other major centers had not. As Damrong put it in
1929:
Those Thai who had established kingdoms in Lanna had only occupied the territory of the present Northwestern [Region] and then declined. But the Thai
who established the independent kingdom at Sukhothai were able to expand
the realm so vastly that it reached other countries. Since then they have ruled
and occupied prathetsayam [Siam] up to now. Thus Sukhothai should be
regarded as the first capital of prathetsayam under the Thai people from B.E.
[Buddhist Era]1800 [1257] onward. 55

Perhaps the famous Ramkhamhaeng inscription has been excessively celebrated partly because it is believed to be one of the oldest pieces of evidence
that the realm of Sukhothai was almost as great as the present geo-body. 56
It is very likely that the changing perception of the geo-body was responsible for this changing spatial parameter of the past. Chulalongkorn 's polycentric Siam seemed to imply the contiguous relation of the spatial units, while
the history of centers makes capitals the representatives of the whole. In this
light, the growing interest in so-called local history in Thailand in the 1980s
and the changing political and economic conditions of Thailand in that
decade, especially the state-promoted growth of capitalism and urbanism in
regional centers, may have some correlation.
Of course, the knowledge of Siam's past has been greatly affected by the
discourse of the geo-body in different fashions and in various degrees. Even
the essence of the indigenous past as the story of dharma (virtue) versus
adharma (evil) was displaced by the story of the national struggle for independence. 57 The past is perceived as the life of the Thai versus other nations.
From the early twentieth century onward, the most powerful and effective
theme of Thai history has emerged. It is the history of "Thai rop phama"
("the Thai fought Burma"). 58 Nationhood, patriotism, and the like become
burdens compelling us to read the past in one way rather than another. History has therefore become one of the most significant instruments in the identification of Thai nationhood.
Perhaps, as in the displacement of geography, there is an arena of confrontation between different discourses of the past-an arena in which the new
past has been unable to expropriate the old one completely. Hence there may
be discrepancies, ambiguities, and traces indicating how the new past has
been created. 59 This territory, however, is beyond the scope of this book.

1
Conclusion

Geo-BodYt Histoty and
Nationhood

THE GEO-BODY AND HISTORY have become powerful technologies of nationhood. The most powerful effect is their operation in the identification of
Thainess, or We-self, as opposed to otherness. The political turmoil in many
places around the world now shows us, as Edmund Leach suggested long
ago, how a boundary violently, arbitrarily, divides ethnic peoples into different nationals. 1 Along the frontiers of Siam, there are many ethnic peoples
who are considered as Thai nationals as opposed to Burmese, Laotian, Cambodian, or Malaysian-or in fact as opposed to being Mon, Karen, Kayah,
Shan, Lao, Hmong, Lu, Lua, Phuan, Khmer, or Malay. Yet by the same
power of geo-body, today it is equally evident that ethnic peoples find it
eminently desirable to have a political entity whose boundary defines their
identity.

The Creation of We-Self vs. Others
In the indigenous Southeast Asian tradition, a subject was bound first and
foremost to his lord rather than to a state. People who lived in one area might
not necessarily belong to the ruler of that area, although they might still have
to pay tax or rent to the lord of that land. As the surveyor James McCarthy
noted with puzzlement, it was a peculiar custom in which the power over
individuals and land was separated. 2 As a modern Western man, he did not
realize that this custom was quite common in the region and throughout
Asia.
It was a puzzle as well for those modern administrators who wanted to
determine nationality-hence national allegiance and loyalty-by geography.
On the Lao-Thai border, once the 1893 treaty was concluded, the Siamese
authorities wanted the boundary just settled to mark the distribution of pop-

164

Ceo-Body, History, and Nationhood

165

ulation as well. Those people who belonged to the lords on the left bank of
the ~ekhong (French Indochina) but inhabited the other side (Siam) were
permttted to return to their homeland. If they did not, they would become
Sia~ese ~y virtue of their residency. The French rejected such an idea, proposmg btrthplace as the first and foremost determination of naturalizationthat is, the Lao of the left bank were always French subjects no matter where
they lived. 3
The politics of this controversy, which lasted for a decade, was the contest
for the control over population, hence humanpower, since the region is well
known for its underpopulation. The Siamese and French authorities tried to
mak~ _these people become their subjects by several measures, including the
abohtton of taxes, handouts of money and clothes, and intimidation. 4 Both
proposals, however, similarly pushed for the shift in the identification and
assignment of bondage or allegiance from the traditional personal ties to the
new geo-body, based either on birthplace or on residence. Siam's proposal
seems to be the more conscious departure from the old practice.
The consequence was twofold. On the one hand, the traditional system of
bondage for control of human power became ineffective. This was one of the
crucial changes which eventually led to abolition of the system. On the other
hand, a new system of identification to make people "Siamese" was urgently
needed. The result was the registration of households throughout the country and the change from traditional lordship to local administration on a territ~rial basis.~ In addition, a Thai prince-governor of the Lao region on the
~tght. b~nk tssued an order to his local authorities to abandon the practice of
tdenttfymg people by their ethnicity in the census and household registration.
Instead, all people must be identified in the same way as "Siamese subjects."6
~lthough the new identification could not be fully implemented in a short
t1me, the geo-body had set the direction and established the foundation for
the new classification of people. In 1941, one of the Phibun regime's chauvinistic ratthaniyom (state prescriptions) was to call all Thai people from whate:er regional and ethnic backgrounds "Thai" without identifying the diversity of their ethnic origin_7 As late as 1967, Charles Keyes reported that the
people on the right bank of the Mekhong still identified themselves as Lao,
although they were more and more becoming "Isan" (northeasterners). He
also observed that by the time of his study the Isan regionalism which had
posed a potential problem of separation during the Phibun regime was no
longer a threat. The regional community had become an identity within the
Thai national domain, and no insurgency demanded a separate state of Isan. s
The "L ao " became " nort heasterners, " a very spatial ethnic/ cultural identification within the frame of the newly created body of nationhood. 9

Conclusion

166

Today the territorial identification of people is newly introduced on some
of the margins of Thailand. In 1986, the Thai government conducted an aerial survey to map the Thai border confronting Burma and Laos. They found
minority people in the area who had been living without interference and
moving back and forth in the territories of the three countries for a long
time. In addition to the map, therefore, a census and household registration
were conducted, as they explained, for security reasons.
As for the task of history in constituting Thainess, the past has also been
created on the basis of binary opposition between what is Thai and what is
otherness. Here the geo-body offers the entities of otherness to history. The
nations nominated as Others are mostly modern states rather than a
fragmented kingdom or a major city as had been the case in the premodern
polity. Moreover, the contrast between what is Thai and what is otherness is
not confined to political entities alone. The Burmese, according to Thai historical perspective, were aggressive, expansionist, and bellicose, while the
Khmer were rather cowardly but opportunistic, attacking only when Siam
was in trouble. It is not hard to see that the Thai characteristics were the mirror image of these traits. The Thai were a peaceful and nonaggressive,
though brave and freedom-loving, people. This is exactly what the Thai
national anthem tells us.
Here, as pointed out at the beginning of the book, the otherness serves as a
token of negative identification regardless of what that nation is or does.
Other nations have always been blamed for damage and evil. It is convenient
for Thai historians to blame the Burmese even for the loss of historical documents, for example, which was quite possibly a result of the lack of modern
historical consciousness more than anything else. 10 But this historian's myth
is in no way exclusive to the Thai. 11

The Enemy Function
The theme of struggle for independence-or, to put it more precisely, the
imminence of a foreign enemy-has become the magic box to generate the
discourse of national security in history as well as in the present. For a striking example in history, consider how a prominent Thai historian has justified
the Thai system of serfdom. Khachorn Sukhabhanij, once again, wrote one
of his classic essays about the phrai, a type of serfdom in Thai society, in
response to a Marxist view of the system as evidence of class oppression and
exploitation in the Thai past. 12 He argued that suffering and hardship (and
oppression?) were necessary and a complaint did not deserve sympathy,
because the enemy's threats and war were imminent: "Individual freedom

Ceo-Body, History, and Nationhood

167

when the country was in trouble was thus properly secondary to the independence of the country and the freedom of the whole nation."tJ Besides, this
Thai situation might not be as bad as the plight of Others: "If the reader feels
that our ancestors were oppressed by their society, I would like to inform
[him or her] that the ancestors of other societies such as Laos, Cambodia,
Vietnam, Burma, and Malaysia were equally or even more severely oppressed
than ours." 14 To put it another way: suffering is tolerable as long as it is for
national security. This strategy of classifying the problem is the same one that
Luang Wichit employed in his plays. The reference to otherness is ideologically meaningful and effective even though it might be academically meaningless.
The discourse of national security is undoubtedly a very effective paranoia
put into Thai people's heads by the Thai state. The creation of otherness, the
enemy in particular, is necessary to justify the existing political and social
control against rivals from without as well as from within. Without this discur.sive enemy, all the varieties of coercive force, from a paramilitary organizatiOn on every border of Thailand to the professional army, would be redundant.' In contrast to the general belief, the state and its security apparatus
survtve because of the enemy. Discursively, if not actually, what actively creates the enemy and produces most threats to a country if not the state's security mechanism? The enemy must be presented, produced, or implicated and
then discursively sustained. It is always projected-if not overtly desired.
When Vajiravudh established a paramilitary force for himself in 1911 in
competition with the institutionalized army, he named it Suapa-presumably
after the guards who patrolled the frontiers of Siam in history. The name
referred to the past, to the border between Thai( ness) and Others, and to the
threat from the enemy. Suapa therefore symbolized the active force which
safeguards Thainess against the enemy. 15 The same reasoning is put forward,
less symbolically, to justify the role of the military. Take one of the present
king's speeches, two months after the October 1976 student massacre in
Bangkok, as an example:
At a time when our country is being continually threatened with aggression by
the enemy, our very freedom and existence as Thais may be destroyed if Thai
people fail to realize their patriotism and their solidarity in resisting the
enemy.... Accordingly, the Thai military has the most important role in
defense of our country at all times, ready always to carry out its duty to protect
the country.16

Who or what is the enemy? Where does the projected threat come from?
Although the wars in Indochina have been a persistent discursive reference



Conclusion

for many decades, the fact is that since the establishment of the professional
military in the late nineteenth century, the Thai military force has been very
active in the domestic theater for the sake of its own political domination.
Fighting against other nations has been rare, and even then one can question
whether it was for the defense of the country or otherwise: namely the disputes with the French over the Mekhong territory, the regiment sent to
France in World War I, the troops sent to the Korean and Vietnam wars, the
semiofficial mercenary force secretly operated in Laos, and the sporadic battles
along the Thai-Cambodian and Thai-Lao borders. To confirm Thainess, it
does not matter if the enemy is relatively abstract or ill defined. The enemy
must always be present.
The creation of enemies has profound effects on the people's perceptions of
those presumed enemies. In 1985, a little-known survey was conducted on
the nationalist attitudes of local leaders, mainly the headpersons, medical
practitioners, and teachers at the district or village levels. The results showed,
unsurprisingly, the strong view that Thailand is a wonderful nation in which
the respondents would love to be reborn. As for the nations they hate most,
Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos scored the highest. Peoples of these nationswith whom they said, Thai should not have a close friendship or marriagewere the most untrustworthy. The Burmese came fourth on the scale of disliked nationals. 17 If one asks why these peoples are classified as enemies, there
will be no clear rationale. The function of otherness does not need an objective explanation. The enemy function needs only to be concrete, real, and
identifiable as the opposite of We-self, regardless of who or what that otherness actually is.
The fact that the geo-body and history have played a great part in the production of Thainess and the creation of its enemies is perhaps best illustrated
in a poster which may not be widespread but is strikingly typical of its kind.
Figure 20 shows a map floating without any global reference in the background. But it is easily recognizable as the map of Thailand. On the eastern
frontier is a picture of a soldier armed with full cartridge belts. His eye is glaring at the Thai map and his mouth is wide open as if he is intimidating-or
going to devour-the map. Obviously he is a communist, easily identifiable
by his uniform, the star on his hat, and the hammer and sickle tucked into his
belt. The most striking feature of this soldier is his shape, which is drawn
upon the figure of a combined map of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. At the
top of the frame is a strip of the Thai tricolor flag above the symbol of the
organization producing this poster. The symbol itself also contains the tricolor flag and the map of Thailand. The caption below reads: "Wake up,
Thai people." In the map of T~ailand, the statement says: "We have already

'

Ceo-Body, History, and Nationhood

169

lost 352,877 square kilometers of our territory. Only 514,000 square kilometers are left." Below the map is another slogan: "Unity is strength; protect
the nation; stop corruption; the nation prospers." At the bottom, the name
of the poster's sponsor is "Luangpho Samniang Yusathaphon." He is a senior
Buddhist monk.ts

The Border of Thai ness
The internal! external dichotomy is one of the most effective strategies to differentiate We-self and otherness. Yet the demarcation between internal and
external, We-self and otherness (or enemy), is sometimes obscure. Even the
geo-body, which should be the most obvious and solid identification of the
Thai nationhood, has limits at those locations where its boundary is not
coterminous with the boundary of Thainess. The domain of Thainess is
rather ambiguous; it can be quite extensive or quite restricted. In 1988 the
country as a whole, with the Thai in the United States at the forefront,
rallied against the Art Institute in Chicago for the return of an eleventh-century Khmer lintel to its sanctuary now inside Thai territory. In fact, the lintel
is a piece, perhaps not even the most important one, of Khmer art in the
period before the Thai ascendancy in mainland Southeast Asia. But as the
awareness of national identity is peculiarly high these days, it is regarded as an
invaluable treasure of Thai national identity. The entire nation was angry
that the Americans had stolen this national treasure from Thai soil. Finally
the entire nation was moved by the return of that piece of national identity to
its motherland-Thailand, not Cambodia. 19 Thainess here is culturally
extended beyond Thailand to include the threshold of the Angkorian empire.
Its operative arena is even in Chicago. Remarkably, a Khmer specimen can
generate a world-wide Thai response simply because of the present location of
its sanctuary within the Thai geo-body.
Another striking example at the opposite extreme is the perception of
communism and Thai communists. Communism in Thai discourse has not
much to do with Marxism as a corpus of theories, political and economic programs, or a sophisticated ideology. Communism is simply the enemy of the
Nation, Religion (Buddhism), and Monarchy. It is simply Enemy Number
One of Thainess and thus external to Thainess. In Cold War propaganda,
communism was normally equated with other countries like Russia, China,
and North Vietnam. But the presence of Thai communists contradicted this
definition, particularly in the late 1970s when socialist ideas were widespread
and thousands of middle-class Thai students joined the Communist Party.
Yet one of the most persistent strategies of counterinsurgency is to link

Conclusion

170

socialists, communists, and the Left with the external threat. As a result,
these students were called "the Deceived," or "our children who are
deceived" (by communists? by Others?), a created category between Thainess and Others. Later the "Deceived" category extended to all Thai communists, including those in the Politburo. After laying down arms and ideology, most of them were granted amnesty and became known as "participants
in the development of the Thai nation." They become "one of us" in the
Thai state.
One of the counterinsurgency forces is the Border Patrol Police, whose
main task is to fight Thai communists in the rural areas. Here the term "border," as it turns out, signifies the demarcation of otherness from Thainess,
rather than signifying a geographical definition. The discourse on the geobody provides an effective figuration to equate the subversive elements
within Thai society with the external threat. Thus the Border Patrol is the
force to safeguard the border of Thainess against the enemy-who are definitely outside such a border, no matter where they really locate. As it happens, this police force can be found operating anywhere from the border
areas, among the minorities (to teach them the central Thai language and
introduce to them the Thai flag, a Buddha image, and pictures of the king
and queen), in a village of Thai peasants well inside Thai territory (to organize a counterinsurgency unit), to an urban center like Chiangmai. It was
also the main force which stormed into a university near the Grand Palace in
Bangkok in the October 1976 massacre.
The "external" may not really be external; the "internal" can be made
alien or external. In every situation, the discursive domain of Thainess
remains homogeneous and unified. In turn, moreover, the terminology of the
geographical discourse, terms such as border, becomes ambiguous. It may
signify something other than space or geography. In the example cited above,
the Border Patrol operates everywhere on the border of Thainess, even well
inside the geo-body. The border of Thainess is much more limited than its
geo-body. The Thai geo-body is not necessarily equal to Thai nationhood.
We may think about all sorts of minorities who are well inside the geo-body
but are on the edge of Thainess, ethnically, religiously, or ideologically, and
are not well accepted into the domain of Thainess. These are the sensitive
areas where a confrontation is imminent.

The Power of Symbols
A code or a symbol, like the word "border" or the map of a nation, does not
necessarily signify the original signified. It can be generative, producing

Ceo-Body, History, and Nationhood

171

many more related meanings. In other words, each symbol has the inherent
potential for multiple signification. The struggle to take control over the signification of symbol is therefore a serious battle-a contest to destabilize and
eliminate certain meanings while asserting another. Hence loyalty or resistance to the dominant meaning of a symbol signifies either submission to or
sedition from the hegemony of a discourse ... and power.
The symbolism of nationhood is normally the conjugation of several discourses, each of which is effective in itself. That makes the symbol of nationhood a rich and potent icon. It has power. One of the best examples is the
national flag. A history of the national flag of Thailand is so far merely a
superficial record of the changes of color, shape, and emblem.2o But such a
history could instead trace the discursive formation of identification of
nationhood. What did it mean when Mongkut invented the flag of "Siam"
as a distinct symbol separate from the emblem of monarchy? What did it
indicate when he chose a white elephant as the symbol on the flag, while the
flag of the monarchy showed Mongkut's personal emblem? What did the
major step of introducing the tricolor as the national flag mean? It has been
said that King Vajiravudh's decision to take the white elephant out of the
flag's design was the result of an accident in which the white elephant flag
was raised upside down. 21 Even if this is true, how did the tricolor become
the symbol? In what ways was power invested in this formulation?
The tricolor flag has gone through several upheavals without change,
while several other symbols of the nation from the absolute monarchy period
were challenged. The 1932 revolution which abolished the absolute monarchy tried to introduce the constitution as the nation's supreme symbol of reverence. 22 The next regime commissioned the composition of a new national
anthem to replace the songs that had represented the royalty in public
events. 23 Moreover, the anthem for Their Majesties was shortened and many
competing symbols were invented. 24 Despite these struggles, the tricolor flag
survived virtually untouched. Why was it so powerful? Or was it simply
weak, ambiguous, and therefore malleable? If this is the case, was there any
shift of emphasis, interpretation, or function in the regulations and rituals
surrounding it?2s
As the flag was produced and sanctioned by the power of the Thai state
and its discourse, however, its meaning and identification are circumscribed
by the discourse of Thainess, which does not include, and may not be
accepted by, the dissidents. Since 1982, when communist armed forces
defected to the government, they handed over their rifles and red flags to the
government officials. In return, they would receive the tricolor flag and a picture of Their Majesties, and finally they would join in singing the national

1

Conclusion

anthem together. This political rite of passage with the tricolor flag and other
symbols transformed these Thai communists under the red flag into members
of the hegemonic society under the tricolor flag. Did it mean that they were
not fully Thai until the ritual was performed?
The power of the flag, and the seriousness of the issue, are acknowledged
by most political forces. On the eve of the popular uprising in October 1973,
the military regime at that time accused the student movement of being communists and said that all the chaos was planned by the Communist Party. To
counter this accusation, when several hundred thousand people began their
march against the junta, they were led by a troop of students who, instead of
arms, held huge national flags and pictures of Their Majesties.
How powerful the symbolism is can be recognized when it is used improperly or challenged. Once a man was arrested because he wore a pair of socks
with the national flag printed near the heels, which is regarded in Thai culture as an offense to the symbol. 26 In another case, in October 1975, on the
second anniversary of the successful uprising just mentioned, a ceremonial
march along the route of the event was planned as the climax of the commemoration. The organizers prepared thousands of small paper flags for the
march, but not the tricolor flag. Instead, they invented a new flag especially
for this occasion. It was in sky-blue with a well-known image of a heroic
moment printed on it in white. At first the artist was criticized on the
grounds that the sky-blue and white failed to convey the uprising's radical
spirit. Finally, alerted by army propaganda, the leadership of the student
movement said that the hero flag should be abandoned altogether because it
could be interpreted as an intentional challenge to the national flag, which
might then lead to an unthinkable political disaster. The heated argument
among the organizers went on virtually throughout the night before every
hero flag was securely put away and thousands of the small tricolor paper
flags were purchased throughout Bangkok in the early hours of the morning.
Were they too timid? Properly cautious? Or should they not even have tried
the new flag instead of having to abort it at the last minute?

A Final Word
The identification of nationhood is a kind of totemism. It has as its basis the
binary opposition of We-self and Others. Certainly there are several kinds
and levels of identification-class, school, region, occupation, nationhoodand one may be in conflict with others. But their power varies according to
the hierarchies of identities. Communists argue that workers should have no
country, for example, and it might be logical to wish that the world of

I
Ceo-Body, History, and Nationhood

173

nations would give way to a new world of internationalism. But Marx and
Engels were too optimistic and deluded by the supranational character of capitalism to recognize that being a worker is secondary to being a national-or
even an ethnic, a Croat, Serb, Slav, Czech, Ukrainian, Karen, Mon, Tamil,
Sinhalese, or southern Thai. Workers hardly united; they usually untied.
Even unity on the basis of one kind of identity may one day be dissolved in
favor of a new differentiation on the basis of another kind of identity. Even a
nation-still a strong and desired primordial identity-can dissolve. And one
day nations will dissolve, perhaps for another communal identity, presumably
a superior one.
The identification ascribed to nationhood does not represent any intrinsic
quality of it. It represents what it creates. The definition and domain of
nationhood are not given. They are constructed, carved, inscribed, fabricated. Nor is its unity given. The identification is formed by the composition
of effects of discourses which define its domain, confer meanings, or confront
each other from time to time. It is always unfixed, ambiguous, self-contradictory, too restricted, yet too extensive. The presence of identity is merely a
temporary discursive conjuncture in which certain discourses have stabilized
their hegemonic forces upon the domain. But other discourses always exist
marginally in certain areas, and new ones can emerge to challenge, destabilize, and displace the dominant discourses-thus reinscribing the domain and
hence the identity. Identity is always in a crisis of contention and displacement; thus it is always changeable. The life of such an identity is neither stable nor continuous. It is full of moments of shift, disruption, and displacement. The study of nationhood should therefore dispense with the illusory
notion of identity. Moreover, since the creation of nationhood is full of contention, struggle, and displacement, a study of discursive identification
becomes a study of ambiguities, misunderstandings, unstable moments of signification, and the extrinsic forces which nurture such identification.
The map has long played a subordinate role in most historical studies.
Now we should recognize its power. Has it been exaggerated here? Perhaps.
But elsewhere it has been definitely undervalued. It is not merely a means, a
verb, of the human subject. It may be the other way round. Perhaps the same
can be said of other technologies. They can be nonhum~n subjects which are
able to turn humans into the agency or even the object of their mediators.
The supposed creator, like a cartographer, is always anonymous and cannot
be held responsible for the fact that the product has gone far beyond control.
Human beings are too often given the central role in a historical narrative.
They deserve a much humbler place in history-as servants of a technology,
perhaps, which is what is really happening now.

Conclusion

A conventional history of a nation is always full of stories of heroism, ingenious leaders, struggles for independence, suffering caused by the enemy, and
so on. They are worth remembering as how we used to remember our past.
But in fact a history of the birth of a nation is full of embarrassing, irrational,
accidental, unintentionally charming, and amusing happenings, including
ideological and psychological cover-ups. No matter if it is worthy and useful,
it is undeniably another history within the same past.
A map created a nation, though not single-handedly. But to give credit to
a map, which is comparatively young and humble in its technical origin, is
inconceivable because it would withdraw the glory the nation has deposited
in the historical account. Yet why is a search for the origin of a nation in the
immemorial past so worthy? Why not look at its obvious components in
order to analyze them discretely to see its ephemeral conjuncture? It is as simple as saying that the birth of "Siam" locates in the composition of the characters S, I, A, and M. Likewise, its geo-body is born in a map, and nowhere
else.

“The Smallness of the Earth” and “the Largeness of the Earth”
— A Grand Idea on 21st Century Construction

1996

Yu Guangyuan

Contemplating the construction of the 21st century, I have an idea, more precisely a “grand idea”, that is, we shall emphasize “the smallness of the earth” as well as “the largeness of the earth”.

The idea of “the smallness of the earth” started to emerge in the middle of the 20th century. People often put emphasis on the limitation of global resources, and realized that the earth as a precondition of humankind’s survival and development can be destroyed by ourselves. The earth is a particular thing, thus surely a limited one. In the meanwhile, human beings will always live on the earth, and hence survive and die with the earth, which is to say that we only have one single earth. Here I think that the concept of the earth should include the moon, the satellites and the space a living person inhabits each time one is launched into the universe and then brought back ­– a space that aligns with the concept of solar system space. Beyond such space and range, even a temporary inhabitant could not survive. While it is possible to launch a rocket that is faster than the initial velocity of the sun, to send back information from out of the solar system, and even to make such a space capsule return to the earth, it is impossible for a human being to live there. Talking about resources, virtually all of them come from the earth itself, except that solar energy is an inexhaustible resource. Thus, the earth is limited whether in terms of living space or in terms of energy and material resources that people can make use of. From the point of view of “the smallness of the earth”, we shall conclude that humankind must protect the earth, which is also to protect the fundamental precondition of our survival and development (which includes protecting the ozonesphere and preventing the escalation of greenhouse gas levels). We must never lower our guard and take this as unworthy of further attention.

What I would especially like to put forward here, besides “the smallness of the earth”, is “the largeness of the earth”. Our technology is not developed enough at this stage, and the technosphere (the space in which people can make use of energy and all kinds of matter by means of technology) takes up only one billionth of the entire volume of the earth. We shall see that as our technosphere continues to grow, our resources also get to grow immensely. Then we can still say, “resources on the earth are limited”, but the phrase now has a different meaning from how people used to consider it (e.g. according to our current speed of exploitation, for how many years petroleum will subsist, for how many years coal will subsist, for how long ferrous and non-ferrous metals will subsist, etc.). While seeing “the smallness of the earth”, we shall also see that many resources on the earth have not been exploited. For example, we can say that seawater is the biggest mineral reserve that we can exploit today, and it would be fairly easy to exploit it. Let us make a calculation: how many tons of metal are contained in the seawater of the earth, among which are how many tons of uranium, how many tons of deuterium? The problem is if we have enough energy for us to extract these. That is to say, to produce more energy and more material resources with what we have. Whether this is doable depends on our calculation and speculation on the profitability. This has not been done very well on a large scale: the marine mineral resources (in the continental shelf and epicontinental sea first, and then in the abyssal ocean) are in huge quantity. But they have been scarcely taken advantage of. In the 21st century, the exploitation of the sea will surely gain increasing significance.

This is not to say there is little potential for continental resources. Let’s ask the question: to what extent have continental landmasses been exploited compared to the ocean? People might be surprised by this comparison and change their past ideas. There aren’t many countries in this world that can make as good use of hydro energy as Switzerland. Hydro energy, although clean and sustainable, is far from getting enough attention even today. There is however no technological difficulty regarding this issue, and what limits us is merely our productivity level and subjective underemphasis.

We shall observe that people are still burning coal, petrol and gasoline as fuel, which is a waste of material resources. This should be improved in the 21st century, if we can develop a system of controllable nuclear fusion for electricity production.

In conclusion, I think we shall conceive the “grand exploitation” along with the “grand protection”. During the grand exploitation, we must research the potential damage to the environment, to prevent its eventual destruction. Indeed, we are in urgent need of the development of technology. The grand exploitation necessitates technology and puts forward technology as “the primary productive force”. Although we should fully realize the difficulty of the grand exploitation, we should also reflect on where the difficulty comes from and how to overcome it. When and where we should progress or retreat should always depend on how much we know about the difficulties that we are facing. Never shall we do nothing vis-à-vis these challenges.
